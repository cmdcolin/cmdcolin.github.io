in technology from inspiring female professors who teach on Coursera.</em></p><p>I don&#x27;t think there is only one way to recruit and retain more women,
because pursuing a career in computer science is such an individual
choice. But I do know that there were two crucial influences in my
decision to pursue this field: a supportive family and early exposure.</p><p>I come from a large family with seven children. My dad was a Physics
professor and my mom was a nurse. I was unbelievably lucky to have
access to a &quot;fun&quot; place to play -- a lab. And while we didn&#x27;t have a
lot of money, we did have a computer very early on. My path to
programming started when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I learned how
to write this program:</p><p>10 PRINT &quot;COLLEEN IS THE BEST. EDDIE STINKS!!!!&quot;\
20 GOTO 10</p><p>And with that looping screen of sisterly love, I was officially a
programmer. I now realize that this early exposure was defining. It
never occurred to me there was anything unusual about me using a
computer. Until, that is, I went to college.</p><p>I was one of only a handful of females in the department and often the
only one in a class. In addition, there were no female faculty. That
was a reason I chose to become a professor -- so I could be a mentor
for future generations of computer scientists (male and female). It
was tough at times, but my family was always very supportive. And
knowing that there were so many ways that I could get financial aid to
continue my studies was VERY important.</p><p>Looking forward, what can I do to help make my reality a reality for
others? I feel that it is very important for me to help other families
realize that providing opportunities for children to experience and
play with technology is important and financially feasible. We need to
increase the number of free programming classes for kids (not just the
number of expensive programming &quot;camps&quot;). During the spring, I usually
spend one day a week for six weeks introducing elementary school
students to Scratch programming during their recess break. I also
coach a &quot;Science Olympiad&quot; team in computing, but I am frustrated that
necessity limits the number of students who can partake.</p><p>It would be wonderful if everyone had a &quot;lab&quot; to play in. Luckily more
and more cities are creating free Makerspaces. As a mentor I have to
do more than take my children to these events. I need to bring others,
spread awareness, and help encourage the creation of other similar
experiences to further increase this kind of access.</p><p>But what about those who don&#x27;t have access to classes and makerspaces?
Is it na√Øve to think everyone can just &quot;join in?&quot; I became a member of
the MOOC movement because I see this as one more chance to give back
for that financial aid I received. I teach courses online because it&#x27;s
a chance to pay it forward by providing access to learning
opportunities to others who may not have been as lucky as I was in my
path to a life in technology.</p><p>\</p><p><em>Other blog posts in Coursera&#x27;s <!-- -->#<!-- -->WomeninTech series:</em></p><p><a href="http://coursera.tumblr.com/post/140643188302/international-womens-day-our-weeklong">International Women&#x27;s Day: Our Weeklong Reflections on Women in
