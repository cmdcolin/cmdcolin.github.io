list, and I wanted to do some basic experiments to look at motif finding
in ChIP-seq.</p><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>I used very basic methods and I have <a href="https://gist.github.com/tonto/8312029">posted some gist
files</a> on GitHub that essentially
follows from <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/gene-regulation-tfbs/">Bioconductor for motif
finding</a>.
I also made up some code for plotting the read coverage of the peaks
using a combination of bedtools and R.</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>The results from plotting the coverage are pretty much as expected
(Figure 1), but I think it opens up some questions when we also look at
the motif map (Figure 2). The enrichment of ChIP-seq reads shows a clear
pattern over the peak summits, but there are some areas where either
mappability was bad (dark stripes) or my algorithm for calculating
coverage has some bugs.</p><p><img src="../../media/72637788100_0.png"/></p><p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Plot of log read counts in 2000bp windows around the
summits of ChIP-seq peaks from a deeply sequenced STE12 transcription
factor pulldown in yeast (Zheng et al, 2010)</p><p>I also looked at the instances of motifs in the same 2000bp window
around the summits (Figure 2). The motif finding produced much less
definitive results, and I was actually verycurious about this. There are
almost perfect matches to the motif scattered throughout the sequences
that don&#x27;t necessarily correspond to the enrichment plot.</p><p><img src="../../media/72637788100_1.png"/></p><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Motif matches from a very basic motif searcher in the
package Biostrings using matchPWM. PWM is downloaded from JASPAR for
STE12, which corresponds to the same transcription factor targetted in
this ChIP-seq.</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>Given the disparity between the datasets, I see a couple possibilities
(as a nive bioinformatics person, biologists please correct me)</p><p>1<!-- -->)<!-- --> We used too basic of a motif finder, and it could not distinguish
the motifs clearly and they may actually be clustered near the peak
summits</p><p>2<!-- -->)<!-- --> Motifs may be enriched in the promoter regions, but more complex
regulation causes true ChIP-seq binding</p><p>3<!-- -->)<!-- --> The motif is simply found very frequently throughout the genome, and
not just in the promoter region, and so like the above we need something
better than the basic motif finding that we have to figure out chip-seq
regulation</p><p>4<!-- -->)<!-- --> Edit: there may also be co-regulation (which is very possible given
the trans-regulators that were found in Zheng et al.&#x27;s results)</p><p>For posterity, here is the seqLogo for our JASPAR STE12 PWM</p><p><img src="../../media/72637788100_2.png"/></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>I have a lot of questions about this data, and I am wondering how we can
use it to further our knowledge of the behavior of the transcription
factors for regulating the genome!</p><p>::: {#footer}
