# About me 


Welcome! This is a minimal homepage for Colin Diesh. I am currently working as a Research Analyst at the University of Missouri in the Elsik Lab



Check out my [science blog](http://searchvoidstar.tumblr.com/) for more posts!


I am also somewhat of an artist and work on lo-tech analog techniques for glitch art. Some of this is on tumblr as well at [http://videomeltdown.tumblr.com](http://videomeltdown.tumblr.com).
