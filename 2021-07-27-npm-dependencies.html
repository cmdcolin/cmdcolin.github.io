your libraries?</p></li><li><p>Did you realize this means that your perfectly running test suite with your
yarn.lock could be a failing case for consumers of your app unless you don’t
use semver strings like ^1.0.0 and just hardcode it to 1.0.0?</p></li><li><p>Did you realize the default of ^1.0.0 automatically gets minor version bumps
which are often fairly substantial changes, e.g. even breaking possibly?</p></li><li><p>Did you know that larger libraries like @material-ui/core don’t like to bump
their major version all the time for example so large changes are often made
to the minor version?</p></li></ul><p>Just something to be aware of! You can always ride the dragon and accept these
minor breakages from semver bumps, but it can introduce some issues for your
consumers</p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/2021-07-27-npm-dependencies","query":{},"buildId":"ir3stmELHQRvEOT9d_k92","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
