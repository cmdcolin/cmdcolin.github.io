# Do you understand how parallelization interacts with global variabesl in jest?

I found that there is a little bit of confusion and misunderstanding around how
things like parallelization work in jest, which sometimes leads to additional
hacking around problems that may not exist or speculating incorrectly about
test failure. This is also of course a point of concern when you have code that
for some reason or another uses global variables. Here are a short summary of
things that may cause confusion.


## Tests in a single file are NOT run in parallel

Simple example, the global variable r is included in the test condition, but it
is accurately run in all cases because the tests are not run in parallel.

```js
let r = 0;

function timeout(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

describe("tests", () => {
  it("t1", async () => {
    await timeout(1000);
    expect(r).toBe(0);
    r++;
  });
  it("t2", async () => {
    await timeout(1000);
    expect(r).toBe(1);
    r++;
  });
  it("t3", async () => {
    await timeout(1000);
    expect(r).toBe(2);
    r++;
  });
});
```

This test will take 3 seconds, and will accurately count the global variable.
If it was in parallel, it may only take 1 second, and would inaccurately count
the global variable due to race conditions

## Tests in different files ARE run in parallel


Let's take another example where we use a global variable, and then two
different tests use the global variable.


file_using_some_globals.js

```js
let myGlobal = 0;

export function doStuff() {
  myGlobal++;
  return myGlobal;
}

export function resetMyGlobal() {
  myGlobal = 0;
}

export function timeout(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```

test_global_vars1.test.js


```js
import { doStuff, timeout } from "./dostuff";
test("file1", async () => {
  doStuff();
  await timeout(1000);
  expect(doStuff()).toEqual(2);
});
```

test_global_vars2.test.js
```js

import { doStuff, timeout } from "./dostuff";

test("file1", async () => {
  await timeout(1000);
  expect(doStuff()).toEqual(1);
});
```


This test completes in less than 2 seconds, and these tests are run in
parallel. They use different instances of the global state, and therefore have
no worries with colliding their state.


export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
