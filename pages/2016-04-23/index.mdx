How to make your resume.json or resume-cli look great
=====================================================

.There are a ton of themes for resume-cli that are not immediately
obvious to find



To see all the great themes on the command line, check out

```
    curl http://themes.jsonresume.org/themes.json |jq .
```

I tried a bunch of them

```
   4679  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-freeland
   4680  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-freelance
   4682  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-with-projects-section
   4683  resume export site/resume/index.html -t dangerflat
   4684  resume export site/resume/index.html -t striking
   4685  resume export site/resume/index.html -t crisp
   4686  resume export site/resume/index.html -t semantic-ui
   4687  resume export site/resume/index.html -t material
   4688  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-extended
   4689  resume export site/resume/index.html -t paper
   4690  resume export site/resume/index.html -t smart
   4691  resume export site/resume/index.html -t flat

```


Note: resume.json is setup to use HTML themes, so even though it has a
PDF output option, it is inherently converting HTML first and then to
PDF. The PDF conversion is done by a automated cloud service, which
currently can fail sometimes. It is probably better to just choose HTML
and convert to PDF if you need to.
