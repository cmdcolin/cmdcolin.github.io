I used **IDR (irreproducible discovery rate)** analysis fto measure the
consistency of biological replicates in ChIP-seq samples. IDR was used
for the [ENCODE project](http://www.encodestatistics.org/%20) for this
type of analysis too, listed here and the software is available as a
small script package here

I setup my BED files outputted from MACS by rearranging columns to fit
the format described as follows:

I used the number of tags mapped to a peak as the signal strength,
sorted the values based on -log10 p-value, and also included the summit
as the point-source value. I didn't have a q-value or strand value since
I used old version of MACS.

Overall, IDR shows that my data are **not** very reproducable with MACS
because the slope of the all peaks matched line is less than 1,
indicating that many of the peaks don't match very well.

One factor that I questioned was my use of number of tags mapped as the
signal strength. Ideally, this would be normalized. More data analysis
might reveal additional information
