Recently, I have been trying to buff up my python skills but i have been
extremely slow

\
I feel like I am python literate, but i am hopeless at writing it. In
part, i feel like i have a lack of motivation and i have been lacking in
finding a good ide. After learning some of the most basic ideas,
painfully, such as

\
import os\
os.getcwd()\
os.chdir('etc')

I started getting a grip. Currently, I am wanting to make a R profiling
plugin for the great gprof2dot app. In this case, I read the line, I
find a call stack is embedded all on that line (different from other
profiling apps that contain call graph format) and then add these to the
function profiles
