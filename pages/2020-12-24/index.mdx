Making a serverless website for photo upload pt. 1
==================================================

I set out to make a serverless website for photo uploads. Our dearly
departed dixie dog needed a place to have photo uploads.

I didn't want to get charged dollars per month for a running ec2
instance, so I wanted something that was lightweight e.g. serverless,
and easy



I decided to follow this tutorial

<https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/uploading-to-amazon-s3-directly-from-a-web-or-mobile-application/>

I really liked the command line deployment (aws-sam) because fiddling
around with the AWS web based control panel is ridiculously complicated

For example I also tried following this tutorial which uses the web
based UI (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw_-0iCVpUc>) and it just did
not work for me....I couldn't stay focused (blame ADHD or just my CLI
obsession?) and certain things like "Execution role" that they say to
modify are not there in the web UI anymore, so I just gave up (I did try
though!)





To install aws-sam I used homebrew

```
 brew tap aws/tap
 brew install aws-sam-cli
 brew install aws-sam-cli # I had to run the install command twice ref https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/2320#issuecomment-721414971

 git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-s3-presigned-urls-aws-sam
 cd amazon-s3-presigned-urls-aws-sam
 sam deploy --guided

 # proceeeds with a guided installation, I used all defaults except I
 made "UploadRequestFunction may not have authorization defined, Is
 this okay? [y/N]: y"
```

They then in the tutorial describe trying to use postman to test

I test with `curl` instead



```

```

The premise of this is you make a request, and then the response from
the API is a pre-signed URL that then allows you to upload directly to
S3. You can use `curl <url> --upload-file yourfile.jpg`. This
automatically does a PUT request to the s3 bucket (yes, this is talking
directly to s3 now, not the lambda! the lambda is just for generating
the "pre-signed URL" to let you upload). Careful to copy it exactly as
is


```
 curl "https://sam-app-s3uploadbucket-1653634.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/112162.jpg?Content-Type=image%2Fjpeg&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAU6CQBER6YBNCDDMJ%2F20201224%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201224T174804Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEDIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMiJGMEQCIH65IvgJsofUpIX46lTaG3Pi5WC85ti1lukM3iICh%2BB%2BAiAJEyynPNPhZN8%2Bg1ylO7wthqud9cBcNIChIp2H%2F%2BR7mCryAQjb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAAaDDMzOTQ3MDI2MzQyMSIMLqPo1IYyH7udCGZuKsYBSEF3c50YXkmPeSWcLsEzq%2BFBTpeOIrwZTyCUjbJ7fgJUakhM1YRX40jExstN8eJcMXqw00Xd5lYHvZDbU9ajwWPLRAxcEN5BQ0utqn0NGTLyJhibzJUj8cjgm5RguIEKe9GUtMVWa9mi7C5%2FlFpS0i9jK5BSVf74JyPSLETV5mzMMzy5kHBQMGjw1dR66E3MG8PjIqfgKjhVtZmlaicf5OmeqNI2%2F8T5ye%2FICRsH4d7KNEmj4FELa8buW8U%2Fn97ThfH3P7XmMNOok%2F8FOuEBDj1EHluCT4DfZ1jIXjvrJsVv1WtV4POQDn2Dah%2BWosBn%2BFNTtQtw841ACDarYR1ZVbuwcpTjfBPlGuSOncPsbzOhzDy7wYyumsPKsXoPdxTncMWbx4BQkbU5SeF9hjpfIKRMSOqkJBN7%2BtgHXwuW1rfYMDN2OAlQZpTj7uWMPWojUMbvMzyHvI2pfgcRAlrBdGGYDigyjWl9QXP%2Bdi6WiR7XCSXbWcIAJDZh%2Beb%2BIH1asmMJtpAK6nMP8gWczaYh7PMeYyVOIs2B20xQBy%2Bz7oe%2BYQ2GfdEr2hgqPH3jd%2B7c&X-Amz-Signature=11b8cd524c25ef51193e3b3fc4816760ebcde8bfc74bd52f3f91d8bf409620f5&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host" --upload-file test.jpg
```

There is no response, but I can then check the s3 console and see the
file upload is successful (all files are renamed)

![](/media/638408397901987840_1.png)

Figure shows that the file upload is successful :)



Then we can edit the file frontend/index.html from the repo we cloned to
contain the lambda with the /uploads/ suffix



![](/media/638408397901987840_2.png)

Figure shows editing the index.html with the lambda endpoint

Then we manually upload this file to another s3 bucket or test it
locally

```
 aws s3 cp index.html s3://mybucket/


# then ...visit that in the browser
```


At this point the files are getting uploaded but not publically
accessible. To make them publically accessible we uncomment the
ACL: 'public-read' in the getSignedURL/app.js folder in the github repo


![](/media/638408397901987840_3.png)

Figure showing the public-read uncommented

![](/media/638408397901987840_4.png)

Figure showing the lines that need uncommenting in template.yaml in the
root of the github repo that allows putObject in s3 with the public-read
ACL



Re-run `sam deploy --guided`, same thing as at the start



Now the objects are publicly accessible!
