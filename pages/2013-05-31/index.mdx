Hi all,

I just created a new webapp that lets you visualize your tumblr notes.
It works by using graphviz and you can try it out for free online here

<http://spark.rstudio.com/grubble/NoteGraph/>

In order to use it, you just copy and paste all the notes from your
tumblr webpage into the textbox and choose which visualizer you want to
use. Then, poof! MAGIC GRAPH APPEARS

I'm still working on customizing it further, and there are still some
bugs, but let me know if you have any feedback or if you need any help
trying it out!

Edit: the updated version is now at
<http://spark.rstudio.com/grubble/TumblrGraph/>
