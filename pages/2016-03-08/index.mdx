> I don't think there is only one way to recruit and retain more women,

>
> I come from a large family with seven children. My dad was a Physics
> professor and my mom was a nurse. I was unbelievably lucky to have
> access to a "fun" place to play -- a lab. And while we didn't have a
> lot of money, we did have a computer very early on. My path to
> programming started when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I learned how
> to write this program:
>
> 10 PRINT "COLLEEN IS THE BEST. EDDIE STINKS!!!!"\
> 20 GOTO 10
>
> And with that looping screen of sisterly love, I was officially a
> programmer. I now realize that this early exposure was defining. It
> never occurred to me there was anything unusual about me using a
> computer. Until, that is, I went to college.
>
> I was one of only a handful of females in the department and often the
> only one in a class. In addition, there were no female faculty. That
> was a reason I chose to become a professor -- so I could be a mentor
> for future generations of computer scientists (male and female). It
> was tough at times, but my family was always very supportive. And
> knowing that there were so many ways that I could get financial aid to
> continue my studies was VERY important.
>
> Looking forward, what can I do to help make my reality a reality for
> others? I feel that it is very important for me to help other families
> realize that providing opportunities for children to experience and
> play with technology is important and financially feasible. We need to
> increase the number of free programming classes for kids (not just the
> number of expensive programming "camps"). During the spring, I usually
> spend one day a week for six weeks introducing elementary school
> students to Scratch programming during their recess break. I also
> coach a "Science Olympiad" team in computing, but I am frustrated that
> necessity limits the number of students who can partake.
>
> It would be wonderful if everyone had a "lab" to play in. Luckily more
> and more cities are creating free Makerspaces. As a mentor I have to
> do more than take my children to these events. I need to bring others,
> spread awareness, and help encourage the creation of other similar
> experiences to further increase this kind of access.
>
> But what about those who don't have access to classes and makerspaces?
> Is it naÃ¯ve to think everyone can just "join in?" I became a member of
> the MOOC movement because I see this as one more chance to give back
> for that financial aid I received. I teach courses online because it's
> a chance to pay it forward by providing access to learning
> opportunities to others who may not have been as lucky as I was in my
> path to a life in technology.
