I have recently been researching the bayes factor and model selection
problemlike we had discussed for comparingChIP-seq data.I would
definitely appreciate it if you do. I have also been inspired by a
recent CS colloqium that was called 

<div>

**"Validation and Parameter Discovery for Stochastic Computational
Models from Behavioral Specifications"**

I was able to see the similarity between the hypothesis testing approach
and the model selection problem from wikipedia:

<div>

"If instead of the Bayes factor integral, the likelihood corresponding
to the [maximum likelihood
estimate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood "Maximum likelihood")
of the parameter for each model is used, then the test becomes a
classical [likelihood-ratio
test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test "Likelihood-ratio test")."
