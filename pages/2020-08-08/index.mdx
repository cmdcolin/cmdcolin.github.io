Peanut allergy
==============

had a pretty bad experience with peanut allergy on thursday. 

order chinese food around 4pm

drive across town to pick it up

there's a car crash en route and the horn is stuck blaring making the
scene pretty chaotic

get the food, drive back home

eat crab rangoon, eat the rice, eat the lo mein, and finally take a bite
of an eggroll

dont really realize instantly but know it tastes weird about halfway
through it

i take 2 benedryl and then start watching youtube for awhile

the pain in my stomach starts making it hard to focus but throwing up is
also miserable so i just wait

11pm i instinctively need to vomit

retching, terrible experience.

my nose closes up which is sign of airways closing, this often happens
\*after\* throwing up\

then i take 2 more benedryl and drink water

then 10 minutes later i have to throw up again, this time pure water and
benedryll powder coats my whole system which doesn't feel as bad but is
still pretty miserable

take more benedryl, fall asleep in a daze

i wake up friday still feeling pretty miserable, i did not vomit out
everything probably so it is still messing up my body

i sleep until like noon and realize i have a work call. i tell ppl i got
a peanut allergy and that i'm zonked so i skip call.

i am definitely zonked indeed, its hard to describe my state but it is
like i had a fever and my brain is melted

i dont understand why an eggroll had peanut in it....google
it....apparently some people add peanut butter to it? weird

my girlfriend makes me a really nice salad for dinner

i google about peanut allergy genomics but dont get too far

i take a shower and sit around in a bathrobe

on saturday, which is today, i am still headachy and fragile but
hopefully recovering

\

random note: i am also allergic to fenugreek, which is closely related
to peanut
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek#Risks_and_side_effects>) and i
only found this out recently. it explains a lot about mild reactions
that i've gotten to indian foods over the years. I also have sensitivity
to soy protein, lentil, and sometimes chickpea especially like gram
flour
