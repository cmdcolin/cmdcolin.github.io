Challenges I have faced learning React
======================================

 Learning React was a big challenge for me. I started learning React in
earnest in 2019. It was a difficult experience overall, but I wanted to
go over my learning experience, and maybe find some lessons in the mix.
This goes mostly into personal details and doesn't really get too
technical, however, I review the commit logs and try and backtrace my
feelings that I remember at the time.

If I were to take away anything from this, it's probably that pair
programming was really useful especially as a remote worker, I had
nothing before that except weekly standups where I felt really
depressed. Also stay patient, stay thankful, and try to focus while you
learn

\

**Introduction to me**

\

I am maybe what you'd call a front-end engineer. I have done web
development for about 7 years now. My first job (2013-2016) was an
academic staff support programming job. I helped with tasks in a lab
with other grad students. This gave me a lot of perspective on weird
hacky dinosaur backends like RoR, PHP, Perl CGI, Java servlets, etc all
collide on the frontend and it is pretty much insane. I got perspective
on dev-ops, full-stack, front-end dev, and data analysis

**Early dabbles with React circa 2016**

I had a random form I wanted to code and wanted to try using React. I
imported React via a CDN  and gave it a shot, and it seemed simple
enough, but I kept getting really confused about what the "state" the
form was in. I didn't realize it then, but I was getting very confused
by state management concepts that I didn't know existed. Now I know that
I was really missing some intro material, for example CONTROLLED
COMPONENTS. Instead, I kept googling weird things like "two way data
binding react" and variants of this. I had never used angular but I
heard of two way data binding, and I just felt like it was what I
needed. I even posted about my frustrations about this on the react
subreddit and was downvoted. Felt bad. I was just really confused. I
abandoned the project in react and just used our normal jqueryish
thing.\

\

**New job in 2018,  while taking grad school courses**

 In 2018, I was taking some grad school classes working on a CS masters.
The algorithms class was hard but mentally stimulating. Most of the
other classes did not interest me, and I did not get very involved in
the school outside of a couple classes. I get a call for this new job in
May 2018, and I am hired on as a remote developer in June 2018. The team
understands I'm working while in school. 

\

I was really happy to be involved. I had worked on the old codebase as
an open source contributor. Now, they decide they are going to do "the
big rewrite" and are going to use React. We do some work trying to
liftover some of the old code into npm modules that can be re-used to
start with, and this was a learning experience, I had never published my
code as NPM modules. I learned jest testing and stuff as well. My first
module was a indexedfasta parser (\@gmod/indexedfasta).

Starting in October 2018, my coworker started building the new react app
prototype. My coworker keeps asking me "what state management library
should we use". I just had no idea about React still, I had not ever
looked into state management, and basically just was like "I dunno!". I
had no way to form an opinion. I was also still taking some classes and
remained pretty out of the loop with prototype development. We would
have weekly meetings but I just wouldn't really understand the goings
ons. This didn't feel great

\

**I am floundering...not understanding what's going on with the rewrite,
so I decide to quit grad school to focus on the new project**

It's December 2018, I go home for Christmas and I have an honest talk
with my parents and tell them "I don't get what is happening in the new
codebase, I'm honestly unhappy, and it just does all this 'react' stuff"
but I can't explain react to them I just say the code is automatically
reacting to other things.

So I talk to my parents about how I'm struggling and they say "well if
you are unhappy you might have to leave your job" and they are not like,
cheering for me to leave but they say that. At this point, it really hit
me that I do like this job and I decided to try to focus on work. I
decide to quit grad school

\

**I try and make an honest attempt to get involved in the project, start
pair programming**

\

On January 10th 2019 I make my first commit to the project by doing some
monkey-see monkey-do type coding. I copy a bunch of files and just put
them in the right place, tweak some lines, and start to figure out how
to make things run. By the end of January 2019 I get my first code
change merged.

In February 2019, I start modifying some more things in the codebase,
just little one-liner bugfixes, which I like more than the large
monkey-see moneky-do file copying and modifying.\

In January, I also suggested that we start doing pair-programming
sessions. This made a huge difference for me in learning how to code.
The pair programming often went way over my head and it felt like my
coworkers were giving me like abstract "koans". Nevertheless, these were
extremely helpful for me to help get caught up.

**I start to reading "Learning React"**

In March 2019, I got the book "Learning React" (O'Reilly2017
<https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react/9781491954614/>)
for my kindle.  Reading this book was a big help I felt, and provided a
needed "brain reset" for me. The book worked well for me, I read it each
night on my kindle, and the functional component concepts were super
enlightening. To me it was so much better reading a book than say and
internet tutorial because I could focus, not have distractions, etc. My
eyes would just glaze over every time I clicked on React blog posts and
stuff before this.

So anyways, March 2019 goes on, and I'm learning, but our codebase still
feels pretty complicated and alien. We use mobx-state-tree and the glue
for mobx-state-tree to react e.g. the mobx-react doesn't really make
sense to me. I remember asking my coworkers why my component was not
updating and they eventually find out it's because I keep not using the
observe() wrapper around my components.

**I start to experiment with Typescript**

In April 2019 I start to experiment with typescript and release a
typescript version of some data parsing code. I start by explicity
specifying a lot of types but I eventually start getting into the zen of
"type inference" and I turn off the
\@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type so I get implied
return types.\

\

**I start using React hooks**

In May 2019 I try out my first React hook, I try a useState instead. It
worked well. I couldn't really figure out why I would use it instead of
the mobx state management we used elsewhere, but the example was that it
was a click and drag and it made sense to keep that click and drag state
local to the component rather than the "app"

\

**I start using react-testing-library**

In June 2019, I create "integration test" level tests for our app. I had
used react-testing-library for some components before this, but this was
using react-testing-library to render the entire "app level" component.
I was happy to pioneer this and was happy to try this out instead of
doing true browser tests, and I think this has worked out well.

Some caveats: I got very caught up with trying to do canvas tests
initially. I really wanted to use jest-mock-canvas but we were using
offscreencanvas via a pretty complicated string of things, so I don't
make progress here, and I also got confused about the relationship
between node-canvas and jest-mock-canvas (they are basically totally
different approaches). Later on, I find using jest-image-snapshot of the
canvas contents works nice (ref
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33269093/how-to-add-canvas-support-to-my-tests-in-jest>)

Other random note: when building out the integration tests, we got a lot
of "act warnings" which were confusing. These were fixed in React 16.9
(released August 2019), but we had to ignore them and they basically
just confused me a lot and made it feel like I was battling a very
complex system rather than a nice simple one.

\

**Conclusions**

Overall, I just wanted to write up my whole experience. It felt really
difficult for me to make these changes. I also went through a breakup
during this time, had a bad living situation, etc. so things were a
struggle. If anyone else has had struggles learning react, tell your
story, and let me know. I'd like to also thank everyone who helped me
along the way. I feel like a much better coder now, yet, I should always
keep growing. The feeling of uncomfortableness could be a growing
experience.
