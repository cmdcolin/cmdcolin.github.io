Compiling wxWidgets 3.0 on Mac OSX
==================================

Recently I compiled wxWidgets on Mac OSX, and i thought it went pretty
smoothly, but I went back over my notes and saw it actually took a
couple twists and turns. I am not sure if all the steps I took were
necessary, but here are some notes I made in case it might help someone.

**Configure wxWidgets**

The command to configure wxwidgets should be simple, something like this

> ./configure --disable-shared --enable-monolithic

However, I ran into some errors just doing this, and with the help of
some forum threads\[1\]\[2\] I was able to build wxWidgets on Mac OSX.
My eventual command to build wxwidgets was a big messy command to force
using c++11 with clang:\

> ./configure --with-expat=builtin --enable-debug --disable-shared
> --enable-monolithic CC=clang CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++
> -std=c++11" OBJCXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11"
> LDFLAGS=-stdlib=libc++
> --with-macosx-sdk=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/
> --with-macosx-version-min=10.7

Note: the folder
/*Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/*
might be different on your machine, as well as the
*--with-macosx-version-min=10.7* parameter (I haven't tested lower than
10.7)\

**Build wxWidgets 3.0**\

Then simply run:\

make && make install

Run it with make -j8 to use extra cores!\

\[1\] I followed notes
[here](http://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=37432) about
using c++11 with ./configure for wxwidgets and linking libstdc++

\[2\] I followed notes [here](http://www.brokentoaster.com/blog/?cat=19)
to fix xml errors compiling wxwidgets which required adding the
--with-expat=builtin argument
