GFF3Sort - A gff3 tabix companion tool
======================================

Almost a year ago today, I helped implement GFF3Tabix parsing in
JBrowse. This is an alternative to the flatfile-to-json.pl pipeline, and
as it happens it is much faster! One important thing to do is to perform
coordinate sorting of the data.

\

Now I am delighted to see a new tool on biorxiv that discusses creating
a GFF3Sort tool that perfectly fits tabix GFF processes, and properly
sorts GFF files for tabix processing. Their tool is posted
here <http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/04/145938>
