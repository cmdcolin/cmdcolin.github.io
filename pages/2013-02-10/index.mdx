Here is the overlap of peaks called on biological replicate experiments
using MACS2 (top) and MACS1.4.2 (bottom) plotted with pybedtools. There
is no configurable text in the figures unforunately, so i'll list the
overlaps and unique values here

\>\>\> (a+b).count()\

Clearly more peaks are called in MACS2. We use the default cutoff for
MACS2 which is a q-value of 5e-2 or a 5% FDR. If a more stringent 1%
q-value (FDR) is used, then we might see similar values. Interestingly,
this contrasts with the 'cutoff' p-value used in MACS 1.4.2 which is
1e-5 or .00001.
