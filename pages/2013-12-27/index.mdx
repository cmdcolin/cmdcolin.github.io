New job
=======

So, it's been awhile since I posted but recently, I started a new job at
the University of Missouri as a research analyst! This is a dream job
for me and I've been very busy since i started in november.

In my new job, I'm working on genome databases and software projects
like hymenopteragenome.org which includes BeeBase, NasoniaBase, Ant
Genomes Portal, and the Bee Pests and Pathogens database.

\
Keep an eye out for new stuff on the website, we will be updating it
soon for our PAG2013 conf :)
