I wanted to make some code that makes a tree from reblogs using the
notes function on tumblr but I couldn't tell if anything like this
really existed before

Instead of googling forever I just made some quick code to do it. The
font sizes are messed up right now cause it's hard to get a layout with
many nodes, but I thought i'd share some of the first results
