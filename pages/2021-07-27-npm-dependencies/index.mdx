You are writing a library...or your writing an app and you want to publish some
of the components of it as a library...



Here are some questions in the form of comments



- Did you realize that your yarn.lock will be ignored for anyone who installs
  your libraries?

- Did you realize this means that your perfectly running test suite with your
  yarn.lock could be a failing case for consumers of your app unless you don’t
  use semver strings like ^1.0.0 and just hardcode it to 1.0.0?

- Did you realize the default of ^1.0.0 automatically gets minor version bumps
  which are often fairly substantial changes, e.g. even breaking possibly?

- Did you know that larger libraries like @material-ui/core don’t like to bump
  their major version all the time for example so large changes are often made
  to the minor version?



Just something to be aware of! You can always ride the dragon and accept these
minor breakages from semver bumps, but it can introduce some issues for your
consumers
