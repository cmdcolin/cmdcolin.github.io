import Layout from "../components/Layout"


Can I rant for a minute? I am just having a really tough time figuring
things out. What happened in my past, what's happening now, what's going
to happen. Tomorrow, next month, next year. Tomorrow, I will be packing
to move to a new house, with a new roomate. I will think about a
vacation but my hopes of vacation are dwindling. Next month, I will try
to audit classes at Mizzou and study for the GRE. Next year, I just
don't know where I will be.

This is really problematic. I almost never write about things, and when
I do I try to make it about technical accomplishments. Generally my
technical accomplishments are subpar in my view. It makes me not sure if
i'm ready for a grad school position. I spend lots of time with grad
students and I feel competent when talking with them, but other people
seem to achieve far more than I do. I feel like the things that other
people aachieve are otherwordly and I don't have any connection to the
deep biology.
