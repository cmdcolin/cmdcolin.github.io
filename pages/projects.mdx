## Work

I am currently working for UC Berkeley on the [JBrowse](https://jbrowse.org)
project, developing structural variant and comparative genomics visualizations.
We are currently working on developing JBrowse 2, a ground up rewrite using
React.


## Past work

- Michigan State University, Gallant lab (2016-2017)
- University of Missouri, Elsik lab (2013-2016)
- University of Colorado, BS computer science (2013)
