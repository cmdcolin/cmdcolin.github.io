> This is a crazy probably repetitive region of the bovine genome. The
> AGP track shows assembly gaps \[1\], and has red tick marks showing
> gaps of unknown size. The FM.01.sorted.bam track is a mate pair
> sequencing dataset, which means that it is composed of many different
> pieces of DNA that are "paired" together, connected by arcs here. The
> strange gaps and repetitions cause the "rainbow effects". Normally the
> reads would be evenly spaced out (and have a consistent color) the
> gaps of unknown size on the assembly force artificially larger or
> smaller gaps between paired reads. Large vertical lines show reads
> that are paired to regions on totally different parts of the
> chromosome (probably another repetitive region)
