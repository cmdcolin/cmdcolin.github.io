GMOD summer school 2013
=======================

Recently, I found a strange little hyperlink that urged me to apply to a
class called the "GMOD Summer School". Where could I have found this
super awsesome link? From Twitter in fact! (that weird website where
everyone posts what they had for breakfast....)  

I am so happy to have found it, at the last minute and applied, and just
now, being accepted into the program!

I am super excited about the possibilities of this class. It is a short
five- day crashcourse on GMOD software such as Galaxy and GBrowse,
JBrowse, and several others, taught by some of the authors of these
programs. I think that I will personally need to practice annotation
since many of these software packages are used for that. I will also
have to start trying to learn cloud computing!

If anyone has any questions or tips see twitter \@cmdcolin or ask!
