The IDR (irreproducable discovery rate) chart is a lot more interesting
if you have multiple different comparisons. I set up a four-way
comparison of MACS2 with MACS 1.4.2 peak calls on biological replicates.

Here, lines 1 and 4 show concordance because it is comparing the same
MACS version numbers. The lines 2 and 3 are the comparisons across
versions of MACS.

In the third graph from the left, the IDR values increase quickly for 2
and 3, but lines 1 and 4 are promising because the IDR values stay flat
before increasing after a number of called peaks.
