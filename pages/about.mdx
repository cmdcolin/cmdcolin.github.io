## About me

I'm a software developer and bioinformatician. I love the command line, and
developing interesting data visualizations. I am currently working for UC
Berkeley on the [JBrowse](https://jbrowse.org) project, developing structural
variant and comparative genomics visualizations. We are currently working on
developing JBrowse 2, a ground up rewrite using React.


I'm from Boulder, CO and currently work remotely from ABQ, NM. In previous
lives I also lived in Columbia, MO and Detroit, MI
