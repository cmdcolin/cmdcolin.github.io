Plotting a coordinate on the screen
===================================

I always end up having to remember the algorithm for plotting a
coordinate on the screen,Â for example an HTML5 canvas and end up
stitching it together manually

If you step through the math it becomes very simple though

\

Say you have a coordinate range of 1000 to 2000 that you want to plot in
a HTML5 canvas of size 100px

First, you want to put your position relative to the start of the range,
so you take\

1500-1000

Second, you know your point is going to be halfway in the range, and in
general, to get this position, you divide now by the size of the
interval you are plotting in, e.g. 2000-1000

(1500-1000)/(2000-1000) = 0.5

We get 0.5 as expected. Then you multiply this proportion times the
width of box you are rendering in, e.g. 100 pixels wide, and get that
you put your pixel at position 50px

To summarize, the general formula for plotting a point x in a range
(x1,x2) on a screen of width w is\

\

w\*(x - Â x1) / (x2 - x1)

Of course same thing applies for y

h\*(y - y1) / (y2 - y1)

\

This does not take into account small possible adjustments for closed vs
open ranges, which could be important to avoid subpixel rendering on a
canvas, but that can be a further exercise
