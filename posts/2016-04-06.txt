Generally it is just a set of directories connected by\n\":\" separators. You can add things to the path by saying \"export\nPATH=$PATH:/new/directory/to/add\" and you can add this to ~/.bashrc for\nexample</li>\n<li>When your install process for a command line tool seems like nonsense, try\nhomebrew instead. barring that, learn PATH, and how to run \"make install\",\netc. Most of your headbashing from installing programs is 90% can be explained\nby not understanding how the developer is intending it to be used, 10% of the\ntool's install process being wrong</li>\n<li>Get a static analyzer and basic tests going on your codebase and run it on\ntravis-ci. Getting started with travis-ci is kind of a learning curve, but it\nis worth it</li>\n<li>Use cpanm instead of cpan for package management</li>\n<li>Vocabulary learning curve: catalina is the same thing as tomcat.

You can write tests proactively\n(i.e. Test driven development), but you can also write them \"reactively\" too\n(i.e. if have a bug that you fix, you can make a test to make sure this\ndoesn't happen anymore)</li>\n<li>Similar to above, tests in this sense are more \"sanity checks\" than they are\nformal proofs. Take \"assert\" logic and \"debugging\" code out of main codebase\nand put them in tests</li>\n<li>Minimize comments in your code, and also don't comment out code and leave it\npresent. Find a way to delete it and move on!</li>\n<li>When you have a bunch of .orig files after doing a git merge, just use git\nclean -f to get rid of them.
