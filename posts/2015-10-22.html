had been running for 25 DAYS on our server</p>
<p>Note: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup
your data first if possible.</p>
<p>First I could obviously see the culprit: each postgress query runs it&#x27;s
own process so I could see in &quot;htop&quot; that there was this process that
had been running for 600 hours, or about 25 days</p>
<p>Next, I opened a psql console and ran this query:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; SELECT datname,procpid,current_query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE
&gt; datname=&#x27;database_name&#x27; ORDER BY procpid ;
</code></pre>
<p>This returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any
given time.  I could easily see the one problematic query being run,
which was a badly constructed intermine template query that resulted in
a weird &quot;recursion&quot; essentially.</p>
<p>I wanted to try just terminating this query itself, so I ran this</p>
<pre><code>&gt; SELECT pg_cancel_backend(29033);
</code></pre>
<p>Each time I ran it, it would say it returned one result but it did
nothing.</p>
<p>I also read that you can try to nicely &quot;kill&quot; it from the command line
(no kill -9) so I ran</p>
<pre><code>&gt; kill 29033
</code></pre>
<p>This also did not work!</p>
<p>I thought perhaps all these problems were because tomcat was still
active, so we shut down tomcat, and retried killing the specific query,
but to no avail</p>
<p>At this point, I just wanted to restart the whole database server. Kind
of a risky move... but I am sort of a risky kind of guy...(that is not a
good thing with databases). If you are doing this, make backups! I
didn&#x27;t. Luckily I suffered no data loss but what follows is kind of
intense.</p>
<p>So first, I try and stop the database service</p>
<pre><code>&gt; service postgresql-9.1 stop
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this <code>[FAILED]</code> ! And of course, even though it failed,
the database is now unusable. No logging into it anymore, we have to go
with the hard way now...</p>
<p>Looking at /etc/init.d/postgres-9.1 told me that the service stop
command was effectively using something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m fast stop
</code></pre>
<p>After some reading, I learned that you can try using a slightly
different flag to restart it</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m immediate  stop
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this and to my horror/surprise, it actually worked! At this point
I decided to start postgresql back up again!</p>
<pre><code>&gt; service postgresql-9.1 start
</code></pre>
<p>The service start quickly returned a SUCCESS, which was great, but then
I tried to start a psql console and the console froze on me! I could not
even ctrl+c it!</p>
<p>I got really worried at this point and I looked at the process manager,
and saw that there was one postmaster process running but it was not
clear what it was doing. I actually tried to shutdown the server again
in a panic mode but at this point it said</p>
<pre><code>&gt; /usr/pgsql-9.1/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /db/postgres/data/ -m immediate
&gt; waiting for server to shut
&gt; down...............................................................
&gt; failed
</code></pre>
<p>It was probably good that it didn&#x27;t shut down, because I would quickly
find out that it was in recovery mode.  I looked at the postgresql logs
and I saw this, reproduced here for full detail (from before the
shutdown to the restart)</p>

<p>You can see all the weird activity that was done here</p>
<ul>
<li>first the attempt to &quot;canceling statement due to user request&quot; did not work</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m fast</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m immediate</li>
<li>the restart (with the HINT, should be ready soon)</li>
<li>the panic mode where i tried to shut it again anyways</li>
</ul>
<p>During the recovery period, I was still very concerned about the
database was doing, so I used &quot;strace&quot; to look at the main postmaster
process.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the postmaster process was just
cleaning up files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/, I could see the
file system &quot;unlink&quot; command with successful status codes.</p>
<p>There were about 150 large files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/,
and I waited about an hour for them to be deleted, and after that, the
postgresql log file said it was ready, and indeed, it was perfect :)</p>
<pre><code>&gt; LOG:  redo is not required
&gt; LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
&gt; LOG:  autovacuum launcher started
</code></pre>
<p>What a relief!</p>
<p>I hope this might help any wayward stragglers to see how the postgresql
restart process works. Sometimes things don&#x27;t shut down cleanly, but I
think it is still good to know some alternative steps to kill -9</p><div style="margin-top:200px"></div></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Blog archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/">Github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdcolin">Twitter</a> <a href="/projects">Projects</a> <a href="/photos">Photos</a> <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a><a href="/about">About</a> </footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Killing postgres the hard way","date":"2015-10-22","slug":"2015-10-22","mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, {})\n  })) : _createMdxContent();\n  function _createMdxContent() {\n    const _components = Object.assign({\n      p: \"p\",\n      pre: \"pre\",\n      code: \"code\",\n      ul: \"ul\",\n      li: \"li\"\n    }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n    return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n      children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"So today, I finally decided to do something about a query that we saw\\nhad been running for 25 DAYS on our server\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"Note: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup\\nyour data first if possible.\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"First I could obviously see the culprit: each postgress query runs it's\\nown process so I could see in \\\"htop\\\" that there was this process that\\nhad been running for 600 hours, or about 25 days\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"Next, I opened a psql console and ran this query:\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.pre, {\n        children: _jsx(_components.code, {\n          children: \"\u003e SELECT datname,procpid,current_query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE\\n\u003e datname='database_name' ORDER BY procpid ;\\n\"\n        })\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"This returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any\\ngiven time.  I could easily see the one problematic query being run,\\nwhich was a badly constructed intermine template query that resulted in\\na weird \\\"recursion\\\" essentially.\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"I wanted to try just terminating this query itself, so I ran this\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.pre, {\n        children: _jsx(_components.code, {\n          children: \"\u003e SELECT pg_cancel_backend(29033);\\n\"\n        })\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"Each time I ran it, it would say it returned one result but it did\\nnothing.\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"I also read that you can try to nicely \\\"kill\\\" it from the command line\\n(no kill -9) so I ran\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.pre, {\n        children: _jsx(_components.code, {\n          children: \"\u003e kill 29033\\n\"\n        })\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"This also did not work!\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"I thought perhaps all these problems were because tomcat was still\\nactive, so we shut down tomcat, and retried killing the specific query,\\nbut to no avail\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"At this point, I just wanted to restart the whole database server.
