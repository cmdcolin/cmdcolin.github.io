had been running for 25 DAYS on our server</p>
<p>Note: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup
your data first if possible.</p>
<p>First I could obviously see the culprit: each postgress query runs it's
own process so I could see in "htop" that there was this process that
had been running for 600 hours, or about 25 days</p>
<p>Next, I opened a psql console and ran this query:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-sql"><pre><span class="pl-k">SELECT</span> datname,procpid,current_query <span class="pl-k">FROM</span> pg_stat_activity <span class="pl-k">WHERE</span> datname<span class="pl-k">=</span><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>database_name<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">ORDER BY</span> procpid ;
</pre></div>
<p>This returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any
given time. I could easily see the one problematic query being run,
which was a badly constructed intermine template query that resulted in
a weird "recursion" essentially.</p>
<p>I wanted to try just terminating this query itself, so I ran this</p>
<pre><code>SELECT pg_cancel_backend(29033);
</code></pre>
<p>Each time I ran it, it would say it returned one result but it did
nothing.</p>
<p>I also read that you can try to nicely "kill" it from the command line
(no kill -9) so I ran</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">></span> <span class="pl-c1">kill</span> 29033
</pre></div>
<p>This also did not work!</p>
<p>I thought perhaps all these problems were because tomcat was still
active, so we shut down tomcat, and retried killing the specific query,
but to no avail</p>
<p>At this point, I just wanted to restart the whole database server. Kind
of a risky move... but I am sort of a risky kind of guy...(that is not a
good thing with databases). If you are doing this, make backups! I
didn't. Luckily I suffered no data loss but what follows is kind of
intense.</p>
<p>So first, I try and stop the database service</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">></span> service postgresql-9.1 stop
</pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, this <code>[FAILED]</code> ! And of course, even though it failed,
the database is now unusable. No logging into it anymore, we have to go
with the hard way now...</p>
<p>Looking at /etc/init.d/postgres-9.1 told me that the service stop
command was effectively using something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">></span> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m fast stop
</pre></div>
<p>After some reading, I learned that you can try using a slightly
different flag to restart it</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">></span> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m immediate  stop
</pre></div>
<p>I ran this and to my horror/surprise, it actually worked! At this point
I decided to start postgresql back up again!</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">></span> service postgresql-9.1 start
</pre></div>
<p>The service start quickly returned a SUCCESS, which was great, but then
I tried to start a psql console and the console froze on me! I could not
even ctrl+c it!</p>
<p>I got really worried at this point and I looked at the process manager,
and saw that there was one postmaster process running but it was not
clear what it was doing. I actually tried to shutdown the server again
in a panic mode but at this point it said</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">></span> /usr/pgsql-9.1/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /db/postgres/data/ -m immediate
<span class="pl-k">></span> waiting <span class="pl-k">for</span> server to shut
<span class="pl-k">></span> down...............................................................
<span class="pl-k">></span> failed
</pre></div>
<p>It was probably good that it didn't shut down, because I would quickly
find out that it was in recovery mode. I looked at the postgresql logs
and I saw this, reproduced here for full detail (from before the
shutdown to the restart)</p>

<p>You can see all the weird activity that was done here</p>
<ul>
<li>first the attempt to "canceling statement due to user request" did not work</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m fast</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m immediate</li>
<li>the restart (with the HINT, should be ready soon)</li>
<li>the panic mode where i tried to shut it again anyways</li>
</ul>
<p>During the recovery period, I was still very concerned about the
database was doing, so I used "strace" to look at the main postmaster
process.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the postmaster process was just
cleaning up files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/, I could see the
file system "unlink" command with successful status codes.</p>
<p>There were about 150 large files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/,
and I waited about an hour for them to be deleted, and after that, the
postgresql log file said it was ready, and indeed, it was perfect :)</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-shell"><pre><span class="pl-k">></span> LOG:  redo is not required
<span class="pl-k">></span> LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
<span class="pl-k">></span> LOG:  autovacuum launcher started
</pre></div>
<p>What a relief!</p>
<p>I hope this might help any wayward stragglers to see how the postgresql
restart process works. Sometimes things don't shut down cleanly, but I
think it is still good to know some alternative steps to kill -9</p></div><div style="margin-top:200px"></div></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Blog archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/">Github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdcolin">Twitter</a> <a href="/projects">Projects</a> <a href="/photos">Photos</a> <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a><a href="/about">About</a> </footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Killing postgres the hard way","date":"2015-10-22","slug":"2015-10-22","html":"\u003cp\u003eSo today, I finally decided to do something about a query that we saw\nhad been running for 25 DAYS on our server\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup\nyour data first if possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst I could obviously see the culprit: each postgress query runs it's\nown process so I could see in \"htop\" that there was this process that\nhad been running for 600 hours, or about 25 days\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I opened a psql console and ran this query:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight highlight-sql\"\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pl-k\"\u003eSELECT\u003c/span\u003e datname,procpid,current_query \u003cspan class=\"pl-k\"\u003eFROM\u003c/span\u003e pg_stat_activity \u003cspan class=\"pl-k\"\u003eWHERE\u003c/span\u003e datname\u003cspan class=\"pl-k\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pl-s\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pl-pds\"\u003e'\u003c/span\u003edatabase_name\u003cspan class=\"pl-pds\"\u003e'\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"pl-k\"\u003eORDER BY\u003c/span\u003e procpid ;\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any\ngiven time.
