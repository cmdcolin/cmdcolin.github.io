had been running for 25 DAYS on our server</p>
<p>Note: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup
your data first if possible.</p>
<p>First I could obviously see the culprit: each postgress query runs it's
own process so I could see in "htop" that there was this process that
had been running for 600 hours, or about 25 days</p>
<p>Next, I opened a psql console and ran this query:</p>
<pre><code>> SELECT datname,procpid,current_query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE
> datname='database_name' ORDER BY procpid ;
</code></pre>
<p>This returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any
given time.  I could easily see the one problematic query being run,
which was a badly constructed intermine template query that resulted in
a weird "recursion" essentially.</p>
<p>I wanted to try just terminating this query itself, so I ran this</p>
<pre><code>> SELECT pg_cancel_backend(29033);
</code></pre>
<p>Each time I ran it, it would say it returned one result but it did
nothing.</p>
<p>I also read that you can try to nicely "kill" it from the command line
(no kill -9) so I ran</p>
<pre><code>> kill 29033
</code></pre>
<p>This also did not work!</p>
<p>I thought perhaps all these problems were because tomcat was still
active, so we shut down tomcat, and retried killing the specific query,
but to no avail</p>
<p>At this point, I just wanted to restart the whole database server. Kind
of a risky move... but I am sort of a risky kind of guy...(that is not a
good thing with databases). If you are doing this, make backups! I
didn't. Luckily I suffered no data loss but what follows is kind of
intense.</p>
<p>So first, I try and stop the database service</p>
<pre><code>> service postgresql-9.1 stop
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this <code>[FAILED]</code> ! And of course, even though it failed,
the database is now unusable. No logging into it anymore, we have to go
with the hard way now...</p>
<p>Looking at /etc/init.d/postgres-9.1 told me that the service stop
command was effectively using something like this:</p>
<pre><code>> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m fast stop
</code></pre>
<p>After some reading, I learned that you can try using a slightly
different flag to restart it</p>
<pre><code>> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m immediate  stop
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this and to my horror/surprise, it actually worked! At this point
I decided to start postgresql back up again!</p>
<pre><code>> service postgresql-9.1 start
</code></pre>
<p>The service start quickly returned a SUCCESS, which was great, but then
I tried to start a psql console and the console froze on me! I could not
even ctrl+c it!</p>
<p>I got really worried at this point and I looked at the process manager,
and saw that there was one postmaster process running but it was not
clear what it was doing. I actually tried to shutdown the server again
in a panic mode but at this point it said</p>
<pre><code>> /usr/pgsql-9.1/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /db/postgres/data/ -m immediate
> waiting for server to shut
> down...............................................................
> failed
</code></pre>
<p>It was probably good that it didn't shut down, because I would quickly
find out that it was in recovery mode.  I looked at the postgresql logs
and I saw this, reproduced here for full detail (from before the
shutdown to the restart)</p>

<p>You can see all the weird activity that was done here</p>
<ul>
<li>first the attempt to "canceling statement due to user request" did not work</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m fast</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m immediate</li>
<li>the restart (with the HINT, should be ready soon)</li>
<li>the panic mode where i tried to shut it again anyways</li>
</ul>
<p>During the recovery period, I was still very concerned about the
database was doing, so I used "strace" to look at the main postmaster
process.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the postmaster process was just
cleaning up files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/, I could see the
file system "unlink" command with successful status codes.</p>
<p>There were about 150 large files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/,
and I waited about an hour for them to be deleted, and after that, the
postgresql log file said it was ready, and indeed, it was perfect :)</p>
<pre><code>> LOG:  redo is not required
> LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
> LOG:  autovacuum launcher started
</code></pre>
<p>What a relief!</p>
<p>I hope this might help any wayward stragglers to see how the postgresql
restart process works. Sometimes things don't shut down cleanly, but I
think it is still good to know some alternative steps to kill -9</p>
