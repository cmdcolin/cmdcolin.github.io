8:T50b0,<p>So today, I finally decided to do something about a query that we saw had been
running for 25 DAYS on our server</p>
<p>Note: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup your
data first if possible.</p>
<p>First I could obviously see the culprit: each postgresql query runs it's own
process so I could see in "htop" that there was this process that had been
running for 600 hours, or about 25 days</p>
<p>Next, I opened a psql console and ran this query:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0" data-language="sql" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="sql" data-theme="one-dark-pro" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#C678DD">SELECT</span><span style="color:#ABB2BF"> datname,procpid,current_query </span><span style="color:#C678DD">FROM</span><span style="color:#ABB2BF"> pg_stat_activity </span><span style="color:#C678DD">WHERE</span><span style="color:#ABB2BF"> datname</span><span style="color:#56B6C2">=</span><span style="color:#98C379">'database_name'</span><span style="color:#C678DD"> ORDER BY</span><span style="color:#ABB2BF"> procpid ;</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any given
time. I could easily see the one problematic query being run, which was a badly
constructed intermine template query that resulted in a weird "recursion"
essentially.</p>
<p>I wanted to try just terminating this query itself, so I ran this</p>
<pre><code>SELECT pg_cancel_backend(29033);
</code></pre>
<p>Each time I ran it, it would say it returned one result but it did nothing.</p>
<p>I also read that you can try to nicely "kill" it from the command line (no kill
-9) so I ran</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0" data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> kill 29033</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This also did not work!</p>
<p>I thought perhaps all these problems were because tomcat was still active, so we
shut down tomcat, and retried killing the specific query, but to no avail</p>
<p>At this point, I just wanted to restart the whole database server. Kind of a
risky move... but I am sort of a risky kind of guy...(that is not a good thing
with databases). If you are doing this, make backups! I didn't. Luckily I
suffered no data loss but what follows is kind of intense.</p>
<p>So first, I try and stop the database service</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0" data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> service postgresql-9.1 stop</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, this <code>[FAILED]</code> ! And of course, even though it failed, the
database is now unusable. No logging into it anymore, we have to go with the
hard way now...</p>
<p>Looking at /etc/init.d/postgres-9.1 told me that the service stop command was
effectively using something like this:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0" data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m fast stop</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>After some reading, I learned that you can try using a slightly different flag
to restart it</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0" data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m immediate  stop</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I ran this and to my horror/surprise, it actually worked! At this point I
decided to start postgresql back up again!</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0" data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> service postgresql-9.1 start</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The service start quickly returned a SUCCESS, which was great, but then I tried
to start a psql console and the console froze on me! I could not even ctrl+c it!</p>
<p>I got really worried at this point and I looked at the process manager, and saw
that there was one postmaster process running but it was not clear what it was
doing. I actually tried to shutdown the server again in a panic mode but at this
point it said</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre style="background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf" tabindex="0" data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="sh" data-theme="one-dark-pro" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> /usr/pgsql-9.1/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /db/postgres/data/ -m immediate</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> waiting </span><span style="color:#C678DD">for</span><span style="color:#ABB2BF"> server to shut</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> down...............................................................</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span style="color:#ABB2BF">> failed</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It was probably good that it didn't shut down, because I would quickly find out
that it was in recovery mode. I looked at the postgresql logs and I saw this,
reproduced here for full detail (from before the shutdown to the restart)</p>

<p>You can see all the weird activity that was done here</p>
<ul>
<li>first the attempt to "canceling statement due to user request" did not work</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m fast</li>
<li>then the database stop using -m immediate</li>
<li>the restart (with the HINT, should be ready soon)</li>
<li>the panic mode where i tried to shut it again anyways</li>
</ul>
<p>During the recovery period, I was still very concerned about the database was
doing, so I used "strace" to look at the main postmaster process.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the postmaster process was just cleaning
up files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/, I could see the file system
"unlink" command with successful status codes.</p>
<p>There were about 150 large files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/, and I
waited about an hour for them to be deleted, and after that, the postgresql log
file said it was ready, and indeed, it was perfect :)</p>

<p>What a relief!</p>
<p>I hope this might help any wayward stragglers to see how the postgresql restart
process works. Sometimes things don't shut down cleanly, but I think it is still
good to know some alternative steps to kill -9</p>
