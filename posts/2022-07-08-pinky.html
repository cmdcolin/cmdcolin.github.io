excessive strain due to hand contortions largely caused by keyboard use.</p>
<p>Particularly brutal in my opinion has been the use of the left-ctrl key for
keyboard shortcuts</p>
<h3>Programs that are particularly troublesome for the left pinky</h3>
<ul>
<li>many programs: ctrl+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+x, ctrl+f</li>
<li>terminal: shift+ctrl+v to paste</li>
<li>tmux: default ctrl+somekey as leader</li>
<li>chrome: ctrl+w to close tab, ctrl+t for new tab, ctrl+r for refresh,
shift+ctrl+r for cache-cleared refresh</li>
<li>vim: using esc key on the far left, custom configurations using ctrl key e.g.
ctrl+p (I also had ctrl+g, ctrl+f for custom file finders for awhile but no
longer)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to make these movements, particularly if you use the left hand to do
it, you have to contort your hand pretty drastically. Chrome is particularly
bad because it is not possible(?) to reconfigure their keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not really listen to warning signs from my hand, and now
there is a mild pain from almost any keyboard usage</p>
<h3>General approaches to help out</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take time out of my day e.g. pomodoro to take rests</li>
<li>Taking a vacation</li>
<li>Do hand exercises and stretches when idle</li>
<li>Massages to the muscles</li>
<li>Using touch typing, making my hands float above the keyboard when typing</li>
<li>Avoiding curling up the pinky while typing (this may just be me suffering at this point)</li>
<li>Use both hands to execute shortcuts instead of contorting left hand</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical approaches and key remappings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remap caps lock to left+ctrl. This is a common one you hear recommended and
it may help, and it has less contortion, particularly for chrome with one
hand use. So you can say capslock+w, capslock+t, but it is still using pinky
and can be stressful if not careful (capslock+w fine, capslock+t still
contortion if done with one hand)</li>
<li>More use of the right-hand-only shortcuts or at least avoiding using the left
pinky for shortcuts. I don&#x27;t have many of these but will look into retraining
myself for some of these. I am testing out right ctrl+] for leader in tmux,
and - and = for split window horizontal and vertical</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is not great to get to this point. My hand posture and body posture at the
keyboard has been bad for years, and it has caught up to me. I recommend people
be aware of contorting their hand too much, and use good keyboard etiquette
lest they suffer the same!</p>
<h2>Any more ideas?</h2>
<p>Let me know of ways you take care of your hands (hardware, software, or
otherwise)</p>

<h2>Extenuating circumstances</h2>
<p>I am not sure if it really affects my typing, but I was bitten by a dog several
years ago. The dog clamped down on both my hands one after the other and got my
left especially bad, which required stitches. One fairly deep puncture was on
the left side of my left hand, which could plausibly affect my pinky. Photo
