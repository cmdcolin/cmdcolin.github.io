If you are\nusing R and Shiny to make a data visualization dashboard, especially if it is\nread only, this can actually be a reality for you: load those CSVs and just\npretend you're a full featured database. I had to actually create some read\nwrite functionality though. This was sort of experimental for me and I'm not\nthat well versed in databases, but I wanted to share my experience</p>\n<p>When I started, I chose grails/groovy/hibernate/GORM as a platform to use. This\nquickly turned into pain when I tried to make a data importer using grails also.</p>\n<p>Each CSV row from the source file would have to be turned into many different\nrows in the database because it represented multiple relationships, example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/158300473458_0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Initially I made my data importer in grails, and was hardcoding column names\nknowing full well this was really inflexible. At the same time I was also trying\nto \"iterate\" on my database schema, and I'd want to re-import my data to test it\nout, but it was really really slow. I tried many different approaches to try to\nspeed this up such as cleanUpGorm, StatelessSessions, and other tricks, but it\nwould take 10-20 minutes for imports on a 100KB input file.</p>\n<p>What I basically realised is that for bulk data import</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Using the ORM is really painful for bulk import.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you can pre-process your data so that it is already in the format the\ndatabase expects, then you can use the CSV COPY command which is very fast</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you can then abandon the ORM mentality and even ignore it as a convenience\nfactor, then you can embrace my database system itself</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, after all this work, it just seemed like ORM treats the database as a\ndanger and something to be heavily abstracted over, but I actually found joy in\nlearning how to treat my database as a first class citizen.
