I was first updated on his progress when he emailed me to get some help\nwith some compiler errors. I was happy to help the young padawan. Here was the\nerror:</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki poimandres\" style=\"background-color: #1b1e28\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">         </span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">test.cpp:42:43:</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">error:</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">non-ASCII</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">characters</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">are</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">not</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">allowed</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">outside</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">of</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">literals</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">                </span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">and</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">identifiers</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">              for (</span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">startScan</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #5DE4C7\">0</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">; </span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">startScan</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">&#x3C;</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> (</span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">size</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #ADD7FF\">âˆ’</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #5DE4C7\">1</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">); </span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">startScan++</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">                                                    </span><span style=\"color: #91B4D5\">^~</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Now, what does this say to you? For me, it was actually very clear what the\nerror meant. It simply meant that this code was taken from somewhere, and copied\nand pasted into the compiler. I know that because if they had typed it themself,\nthey definitely would not get this error, because it is the error that implies\nsomething was automatically converted to a unicode dash, mostly something done\nduring copying and pasting. At this point, I just kind of laughed, and helped\nhim fix that. I showed how the compiler is actually pretty smart and can help\nfix these errors and then I said \"l8r dude\".</p>\n<p>The next week, I had another skype meeting with him, and this time I wanted to\nhelp a little more. It was pretty clear when we started that he was using code\nthat was copied and pasted again. I said, \"uh, ok,....I'm not sure we need that\nnow, but let's just keep going\", and then I sat down and started helping. I\nwanted to help get all the details of the program working, so I helped guide the\nsolution. Each time we needed to test the program, it required repeating some\ninput lines via <code>cin >></code>, which is really annoying (obviously, you should test\nyour code with unit tests, but universities don't teach that, a rant for another\nday). Anyways, it took awhile, because coding really does just take time, but in\nthe end he finally got it fixed and I said great job, and he turned it in!</p>\n<p>Now, on my friends last assignment, I got another call for help, and when we\nstarted skype, I found yet again that he had copied code from somewhere, which\nincluded a C++ class and a main function for doing binary trees. I just simply\nsaid \"dude, delete that, we don't need it\" and so he deleted it, but I think\nmaybe he had worked on this copied code for awhile, and maybe felt it was kind\nof his, so was apprehensive. I insisted though. Then we walked through the\nassignment again, very slowly. I spent probably 2-3 hours helping him out that\nnight. During those hours, I saw him continually making many programming\nmistakes such as just not knowing how to declare variable or a function\nproperly, or just not knowing what to do next. This was kind of frustrating!!!\nBut I wanted to absolutely teach him how to make it right! I was patient though,\nand I wanted to teach a fun lesson, so I showed how you can do some \"unit tests\"\nwhich avoids having to constantly re-enter your data via <code>cin >> </code>....</p>\n<p>Now, the padawan completed his C++ class, and then we all were happy ever\nafter....but a disturbance in the force was sensed...</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://zelcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stackoverflow-logo-dumpster.jpg\" alt=\"image\">\nImage from <a href=\"http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/\">http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/</a></p>\n<p>I was reminded about all this due to seeing that\n<a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-on-the-stack-excha\">StackOverflow is now changing their \"license\" over all the little snippets of code</a>\nthat are posted on their site. It just makes me reflect on literally HOW OFTEN\nPEOPLE JUST COPY AND PASTE FROM THERE. They might understand what they are\ndoing, or they seriously might not!!! I think it is a real problem that people\nsometimes do not understand, but I cannot deny that it can be helpful too.</p>\n<p>If I reflect on education in general, I recall when I took a University level\nphysics class... it was really hard! We had to enter our validated solutions for\nthe math problems into a computerized website homework portal, and that involved\nbeing 100% correct about things. Now, what if there was just a physicsoverflow,\nwhere they not only had Q&#x26;A, but they had \"programs\" that gave you all the right\nanswers to your homework problems that you could just copy and paste and use as\nsolutions to your homework? This isn't even in the realm of asking for \"homework\nhelp\" anymore, this is just pure cheating if you can copy your answers from\nsomewhere. It is disappointing though because this is what people are doing in\ncomputer science!! These students are missing out on basic understanding of\ncode. !!thisIsNotOk();</p>\n<p>Now, at least when I was being a tutor for my friend, I felt like my advice\nhelped my friend learn some things, not just give answers. But what if I was not\nthere? I guess there is a certain \"impersonal quality\" that makes asking\nGoogle/StackOverflow for answers less like conventional \"cheating\", but that is\nstill wrong. I think it would be good if more expert knowledge was available for\nall people, and not just copy and paste snippets. As a start, I thought that\n<a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192385-life-after-moocs/fulltext\">this post by Philip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner</a>\n(who teach a Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC on Coursera) was very interesting,\nand I really liked their quote:</p>\n<p>\"Online education should move toward replicating the experience of receiving\none-on-one tutoring.\"</p>\n<p>That sounds great, but how can this be achieved? And how can it be done right? I\nthink it really requires the student to \"learn how to learn\"</p>\n<p>If I think back to a long time ago, I remember being in 4th or 5th grade and I\ndid a book report on World War 1, and I went to the library. I remember\ndesperately flipping through pages of a 100 page book to try to find some\nsnippets of information to support some basic idea that I wanted to talk about.\nMaybe I wanted to know something specific, but the problem was that I wasn't\nREALLY READING THE BOOK! I probably could have had a better understanding of the\ntopic if I had just read it, or even a part of it, and asked for help, but\ninstead I just picked and chose snippets from the book to \"sound smart\". I am\nvery guilty of this type of error in many instances throughout my school career,\nso I am no saint! I even have a phrase to describe this style of learning...I\ncall it \"predatory learning\" and it is probably the worst kind of learning\nstyle. Predatory learners often pick and choose from scraps of info, but they\nnever get a full meal!</p>"}}],["$","$L9",null,{}]]}]
