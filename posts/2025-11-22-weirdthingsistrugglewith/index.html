that other people have, but also I am often off on a crazy mission that I’m not
sure anyone else would really care about</p>
<p>In any case, here are some struggles that I seem to grapple with a lot. Share
your own struggles. I may update this post over time with more detail or
examples</p>
<h2 id="limits-of-static-site-systems">Limits of static site systems</h2>
<p>This is an ongoing saga for me but I generated a static site with over 100,000
pages. It is kind of ridiculous. There is no login or dynamic behavior really,
just a ton of static pages</p>
<h2 id="tension-between-web-worker-and-main-thread-work">Tension between web worker and main thread work</h2>
<p>Web workers are cool. But they are really tough to grapple with. There is a
large serialization overhead and so you have to design complex systems for the
main thread and the web worker to communicate partial results</p>
<h2 id="tension-between-using-react-and-client-side-js-at-all-versus-just-having-plain-html">Tension between using React and client side JS at all versus just having plain html</h2>
<p>If you’re a React person shaking your damn head thinking this guy is a damn
fool, just know I have deeply invested years of my life into react. React
enables us to make overly complicated website apps, tons of rope to hang
ourselves with, and the result is often much slower to boot. People frequently
talk about “virtualizing” after no more than like 20 items on the page. Fuck
that</p>
<h2 id="tension-where-in-the-system-is-best-to-cache">Tension where in the system is best to cache</h2>
<p>If you cache at too low of a level, how do you know how big the cache can be. If
you cache at a very high level, you have to wire that through every part of your
apps code? I don’t use redis, I am thinking about caching client side js things.</p>
<h2 id="tension-where-in-the-system-is-best-to-parallelize-on">Tension where in the system is best to parallelize on</h2>
<p>I have a system where data items go through a series of N processing steps</p>
<p>My first attempt at the system was to make N scripts, each performing the
processing on each item</p>
<p>However, now I try to synchronize with the remote, and I now literally re-run
every processing step on every data item on every update</p>
<p>You could think of other ways of doing this (a single script that runs all N
steps, and then only run the update on new files, but there is inertia from my
early choice to do things this way that makes it hard to change</p>
<h2 id="other-examples">Other examples</h2>
<p>Tension about what belongs in an application state (e.g. survives page refresh)
versus what is volatile and doesn’t need persisting</p>
<ul>
<li>Tension about user preferences versus app level configuration</li>
<li>Tension between assuming something can be resolved statically versus doing
asynchronous lookup for everything</li>
<li>Tension between designing abortability into computation heavy workflows</li>
