even seems that there are people behind it which kinda makes me feel bad to
complain about it, but I keep seeing this spam-type substance on my sacred
forums.</p>
<p>Many of these posts come from a blog called devinterrupted. They post things
related to “engineering management” type topics. And, they often “hit a chord”
and get highly upvoted and replied to. It’s often the type of thing everyone can
add their two cents on, or offload some steam. One person called it engagement
spam and that seems about right.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t all be so bad, but it is sometimes posted with formulaic titles,
created by sock puppet accounts and promoting a specific company (linearB). I
gathered as many posts from them as I can, helpfully grouped into clickbait-y
categories.</p>
<p>Update 2023-01-06: a Reddit user reached out to me who is quite knowledgeable
about astroturfing campaigns and confirmed my suspicions here that it’s all sock
puppet accounts</p>

<p>“There should never be coding exercises in technical interviews. It favors
people who have time to do them. Disfavors people with FT jobs and families.
Plus, your job won’t have people over your shoulder watching you code.” My

hours a month in meetings than devs in smaller orgs. It’s been dubbed the
“coordination tax.”

<p>TIL 9 out of 10 devs said they would give up 24% of their lifetime earnings if
they got more meaning in their jobs. Also, 84% say they’re disengaged at work
and don’t trust their company leaders.

<p>TIL about the “Intent-Perception Gap” in programming. Best exemplified when a
CTO or manager casually suggests something to their developers they take it as
a new work commandment or direction for their team.

<p>“Dev burnout drastically decreases when you actually ship things regularly.
Burnout is caused by crap like toil, rework and spending too much mental
energy on bottlenecks.” Cool conversation with the head engineer of Slack on
how burnout is caused by all the things that keep devs from coding.

<p>“The modern pull-request process has caused inefficiencies, particularly
review delays, as it isn’t automated, so speed depends on the availability of
the right code reviewer.” Interesting blog arguing for filtering pull requests
based on risk in order to promote “continuous merge.” (Post deleted, called

<p>“Too many companies treat dev burnout like a 24-hour flu where they can just
send a person home or tell them to take the day off.” A trained
therapist-turned-engineer reveals how she diagnoses healthy dev teams from
ones doomed to fail.

<p>There was another highly upvoted post about “cycle time” posted to
/r/programming probably that I cannot find now</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The devinterrupted blog/podcast appears to be related to the linearB company,
who advocate a notion of “cycle time” (<a href="https://linearb.io/blog/cycle-time/">https://linearb.io/blog/cycle-time/</a>) as a
developer metric engineering managers should look at. They interview some
interesting people but someone referred to it as “engagement spam”. They promote
the “gitStream” product on all the posts on devinterrupted.
<a href="https://linearb.io/dev/gitstream/">https://linearb.io/dev/gitstream/</a></p>
<p>Update 2023: I would bet the “contextkeeper” blog is related because some
sockpuppet accounts are posting from both blogs</p>
<p>I’d recommend linearB stop posting these things, or pretending that they are not
behind these posts.</p> </div> <div id="giscus"></div> <script>
