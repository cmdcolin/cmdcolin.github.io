for a friend in a computer science class, and talk about a nagging feeling that
really felt wrong for me.</p>
<p>So, a long time ago, in a land far far away, a friend took an intermediate
class on C++. I was first updated on his progress when he emailed me to get
some help with some compiler errors. I was happy to help the young padawan.
Here was the error:</p>
<pre class="shiki" style="background-color: #1b1e28"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #A6ACCD">         test.cpp:42:43: error: non-ASCII characters are not allowed outside of literals</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #A6ACCD">                and identifiers</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #A6ACCD">              for (startScan = 0</span><span style="color: #91B4D5">;</span><span style="color: #A6ACCD"> startScan </span><span style="color: #91B4D5">&#x3C;</span><span style="color: #A6ACCD"> (size − 1)</span><span style="color: #91B4D5">;</span><span style="color: #A6ACCD"> startScan++)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #A6ACCD">                                                    ^~</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now, what does this say to you? For me, it was actually very clear what the
error meant. It simply meant that this code was taken from somewhere, and
copied and pasted into the compiler. I know that because if they had typed it
themself, they definitely would not get this error, because it is the error
that implies something was automatically converted to a unicode dash, mostly
something done during copying and pasting. At this point, I just kind of
laughed, and helped him fix that. I showed how the compiler is actually pretty
smart and can help fix these errors and then I said "l8r dude".</p>
<p>The next week, I had another skype meeting with him, and this time I wanted to
help a little more. It was pretty clear when we started that he was using code
that was copied and pasted again. I said, "uh, ok,....I'm not sure we need that
now, but let's just keep going", and then I sat down and started helping. I
wanted to help get all the details of the program working, so I helped guide
the solution. Each time we needed to test the program, it required repeating
some input lines via <code>cin >></code>, which is really annoying (obviously, you should
test your code with unit tests, but universities don't teach that, a rant for
another day). Anyways, it took awhile, because coding really does just take
time, but in the end he finally got it fixed and I said great job, and he
turned it in!</p>
<p>Now, on my friends last assignment, I got another call for help, and when we
started skype, I found yet again that he had copied code from somewhere, which
included a C++ class and a main function for doing binary trees. I just simply
said "dude, delete that, we don't need it" and so he deleted it, but I think
maybe he had worked on this copied code for awhile, and maybe felt it was kind
of his, so was apprehensive. I insisted though. Then we walked through the
assignment again, very slowly. I spent probably 2-3 hours helping him out that
night. During those hours, I saw him continually making many programming
mistakes such as just not knowing how to declare variable or a function
properly, or just not knowing what to do next. This was kind of frustrating!!!
But I wanted to absolutely teach him how to make it right! I was patient
though, and I wanted to teach a fun lesson, so I showed how you can do some
"unit tests" which avoids having to constantly re-enter your data via <code>cin >> </code>....</p>
<p>Now, the padawan completed his C++ class, and then we all were happy ever
after....but a disturbance in the force was sensed...</p>

<p>I was reminded about all this due to seeing that <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-on-the-stack-excha">StackOverflow is now changing
their "license" over all the little snippets of
code</a>
that are posted on their site. It just makes me reflect on literally HOW OFTEN
PEOPLE JUST COPY AND PASTE FROM THERE. They might understand what they are
doing, or they seriously might not!!! I think it is a real problem that people
sometimes do not understand, but I cannot deny that it can be helpful too.</p>
<p>If I reflect on education in general, I recall when I took a University level
physics class... it was really hard! We had to enter our validated solutions
for the math problems into a computerized website homework portal, and that
involved being 100% correct about things. Now, what if there was just a
physicsoverflow, where they not only had Q&#x26;A, but they had "programs" that gave
you all the right answers to your homework problems that you could just copy
and paste and use as solutions to your homework? This isn't even in the realm
of asking for "homework help" anymore, this is just pure cheating if you can
copy your answers from somewhere. It is disappointing though because this is
what people are doing in computer science!! These students are missing out on
basic understanding of code. !!thisIsNotOk();</p>
<p>Now, at least when I was being a tutor for my friend, I felt like my advice
helped my friend learn some things, not just give answers. But what if I was
not there? I guess there is a certain "impersonal quality" that makes asking
Google/StackOverflow for answers less like conventional "cheating", but that is
still wrong. I think it would be good if more expert knowledge was available
for all people, and not just copy and paste snippets. As a start, I thought
that <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192385-life-after-moocs/fulltext">this post by Philip Compeau and Pavel
Pevzner</a>
(who teach a Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC on Coursera) was very interesting,
and I really liked their quote:</p>
<p>"Online education should move toward replicating the experience of receiving
one-on-one tutoring."</p>
<p>That sounds great, but how can this be acheived? And how can it be done right?
I think it really requires the student to "learn how to learn"</p>
<p>If I think back to a long time ago, I remember being in 4th or 5th grade and I
did a book report on World War 1, and I went to the library. I remember
desperately flipping through pages of a 100 page book to try to find some
snippets of information to support some basic idea that I wanted to talk about.
Maybe I wanted to know something specific, but the problem was that I wasn't
REALLY READING THE BOOK! I probably could have had a better understanding of
the topic if I had just read it, or even a part of it, and asked for help, but
instead I just picked and chose snippets from the book to "sound smart". I am
very guilty of this type of error in many instances throughout my school
career, so I am no saint! I even have a phrase to describe this style of
learning...I call it "predatory learning" and it is probably the worst kind of
learning style. Predatory learners often pick and choose from scraps of info,
but they never get a full meal!</p></div><div style="margin-top:200px"></div></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Blog archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/">Github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdcolin">Twitter</a> <a href="/projects">Projects</a><a href="/photos">Photos</a> <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a><a href="/about">About</a></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Cheating in your computer science class by copying from stackoverflow","date":"2015-12-17","slug":"2015-12-17","html":"\u003cp\u003eI would like to tell a story about how I provided some personal tutoring help\nfor a friend in a computer science class, and talk about a nagging feeling that\nreally felt wrong for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, a long time ago, in a land far far away, a friend took an intermediate\nclass on C++.
