especially if it is read only, this can actually be a reality for you: load
those CSVs and just pretend you&#x27;re a full featured database. I had to actually

many different approaches to try to speed this up such as cleanUpGorm,
StatelessSessions, and other tricks, but it would take 10-20 minutes for
