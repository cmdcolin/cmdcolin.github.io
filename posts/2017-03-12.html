given several CSV files with some expectation that these files could
basically be just loaded into a database and jumped into production really
quickly. If you are using R and Shiny to make a data visualization dashboard,
especially if it is read only, this can actually be a reality for you: load
those CSVs and just pretend you're a full featured database. I had to actually
create some read write functionality though. This was sort of experimental for
me and I'm not that well versed in databases, but I wanted to share my
experience</p>
<p>When I started, I chose grails/groovy/hibernate/GORM as a platform to
use. This quickly turned into pain when I tried to make a data importer
using grails also.</p>
<p>Each CSV row from the source file would have to be turned into many
different rows in the database because it represented multiple
relationships, example:</p>
<p><img src="/media/158300473458_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Initially I made my data importer in grails, and was hardcoding column
names knowing full well this was really inflexible. At the same time I
was also trying to "iterate" on my database schema, and I'd want to
re-import my data to test it out, but it was really really slow. I tried
many different approaches to try to speed this up such as cleanUpGorm,
StatelessSessions, and other tricks, but it would take 10-20 minutes for
imports on a 100KB input file.</p>
<p>What I basically realised is that for bulk data import</p>
<p><strong>1) Using the ORM is really painful for bulk import.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) If you can pre-process your data so that it is already in the
format the database expects, then you can use the CSV COPY command which
is very fast</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) If you can then abandon the ORM mentality and even ignore it as
a convenience factor, then you can embrace my database system itself</strong></p>
<p>Overall, after all this work, it just seemed like ORM treats the
database as a danger and something to be heavily abstracted over, but I
actually found joy in learning how to treat my database as a first class
citizen. Soon I started gaining appreciation of</p>
<ul>
<li>using plain SQL queries</li>
<li>learning about full text search in postgres with ts_query</li>
<li>learning about triggers to make a "last updated" field get updated
automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I am pretty happy this way, and although I miss some things like
criteria queries which are very powerful, I am happy that I can interact
with my database as a friend</p>
<p>At the very least, due to the fact that I now pre-process the data
before database loading, I can now import large amounts of data super
fast with the CSV COPY command</p></div><div style="margin-top:200px"></div></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Blog archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/">Github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdcolin">Twitter</a> <a href="/projects">Projects</a> <a href="/photos">Photos</a> <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a><a href="/about">About</a> </footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"How I learned to hate ORM (especially for data import scripts)","date":"2017-03-12","slug":"2017-03-12","html":"\u003cp\u003eWhen I was tasked with making a new application for our websites, I was\ngiven several CSV files with some expectation that these files could\nbasically be just loaded into a database and jumped into production really\nquickly.
