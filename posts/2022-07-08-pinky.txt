This can\ncause issues sometimes called \"ulnar tunnel\" or \"cubital tunnel\" which is\nrelatively distinct from \"carpal tunnel\" and is more strongly related to the\nring and pinky fingers! You can get ring/pinky pain from compression of the\nnerve near the wrist or near the elbow, but the elbow is quite common.</p>\n<p>Some notes about improving elbow ergonomics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid applying too much pressure to elbows on armrests (ulnar nerve) while at\ndesk</li>\n<li>Avoid typing with elbows bent e.g. straighten arms</li>\n<li>Avoid sleeping with elbows super bent e.g. I get this sleeping on my stomach\nwith my elbows under my body.

This is a common one you hear recommended and it\nmay help, and it has less contortion, particularly for chrome with one hand\nuse. So you can say capslock+w, capslock+t, but it is still using pinky and\ncan be stressful if not careful (capslock+w fine, capslock+t still contortion\nif done with one hand)</li>\n<li>More use of the right-hand-only shortcuts or at least avoiding using the left\npinky for shortcuts. I don't have many of these but will look into retraining\nmyself for some of these. I am testing out right ctrl+] for leader in tmux,\nand - and = for split window horizontal and vertical</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\"><a href=\"#things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Things still to try: better ergonomics and gadgets</h3>\n<p>In truth, I type a lot on a laptop with a poor keyboard layout, and often use it\naway from a desk. I think improving my desk ergonomics could help, and getting a\nfancy keyboard and maybe mouse (though I much prefer a touchpad) could be a next\nfrontier, along with ensuring proper desk height, chair height, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is not great to get to this point. My hand posture and body posture at the\nkeyboard has been bad for years, and it has caught up to me. Learning the\nconnection with my elbow and ulnar nerve was very enlightening for my situation.\nThe common problem many people discuss is carpal tunnel related, but the ulnar\nis actually a relatively separate problem, though related in many ways too. I\nrecommend people be aware of contorting their hand or applying pressure on their\nelbows too much, lest they suffer the same!</p>\n<h2 id=\"any-more-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#any-more-ideas\"><a href=\"#any-more-ideas\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Any more ideas?</h2>\n<p>Let me know of ways you take care of your hands (hardware, software, or\notherwise)</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#other-resources\"><a href=\"#other-resources\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Other resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>See this post by Matt Might for some more resources\n<a href=\"https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/\">https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ulnar tunnel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_tunnel_syndrome\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_tunnel_syndrome</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}}],["$","$L8",null,{}]]}]
