experiences with AI. I have this feeling that people think that talking about AI
usage is a little taboo.</p>
<h2 id="my-early-impressions-with-ai">My early impressions with AI</h2>
<p>My first experience with AI was being incredible skeptical. I really disliked
OpenAI…I still do not use any of their products. I started seeing projects
everywhere on GitHub that require an “OPENAI_API_KEY”. I did not use these, and
did not really feel like I needed to, though there was clearly some “blood in
the water” making everyone go crazy</p>
<p>My early feelings about AI also involved being upset that AI couldn’t “cite its
sources”. I had this idea in my head that AI was a galaxy brain…or should be a
galaxy brain… that could draw from an immense pool of knowledge. However, one
thing that shifted my thinking on this was reading “4.2 Gigabytes, or: How to
Draw Anything” <a href="https://debugti.me/posts/how-to-draw/">https://debugti.me/posts/how-to-draw/</a></p>
<p>This made me realize AI are ‘compressed representations’ of a lot of
knowledge…weird!</p>
<h2 id="my-early-experiences-with-using-ai-chatbots">My early experiences with using AI chatbots</h2>
<p>Despite my OpenAI stance, once Google came out with Bard, I started asking it
some questions. It was pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Some early experiences I had with Bard was trying to get it to convert code from
one language (python) to another (JS). It was very good at doing this, which was
wild to me. These language translations would take a lot of time to do by
hand… and it would spit it out in seconds!</p>
<h2 id="early-experience-with-text-editor-integration-avantenvim">Early experience with text editor integration: Avante.nvim</h2>
<p>My first experience with ‘buying’ into the AI was purchasing 20 bucks of API
tokens from Anthropic, and using it with Avante.nvim.</p>
<p>I liked the minimalism of Avante.nvim, and got stuck with the keybindings, and
didn’t really want to try any others like CodeCompanion.</p>
<p>You could launch a chat sidebar with <leader>aa or get it to edit a block with
visual select <leader>ae</leader></leader></p>
<p>I had some pretty unique successes. It fixed some bugs parsing a very complex
file format (CRAM). I can’t imagine it had much ‘training’ data on this, but it
came up with a very successful solution to a weird bug, and I posted a full
chatlog on my early PRs using this (example Dec 2024,
<a href="https://github.com/GMOD/cram-js/pull/150">https://github.com/GMOD/cram-js/pull/150</a>)</p>
<p>Around February 2025, Claude introduced 3.7 which added tool calling, which are
basically ‘agentic’ workflows. These were integrated with Avante.nvim but they
were not super reliable though and I was pretty unhappy with this because it
seemed like:</p>
<ol>
<li>this ‘tool calling’ was an overrreach…I did not like it mucking about, and
it costed more in API tokens</li>
<li>it also did not work well. I reported several bugs related to this on the
Avante.nvim github (e.g. “bug: Avante Gets stuck on tool calling and never
progresses past that point”, “bug: Sonnet just runs in loops, reading the
same file over and over again”, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, one rainy day in May 2025 when Avante.nvim was really not working I
felt very stuck. On reflection, I think that’s when I realized that maybe
Avante.nvim was causing me more grief than help…see also Footnote 2</p>
<h2 id="switching-to-claude-code">Switching to Claude Code</h2>
<p>Not sure what exact date, but eventually, I decided to try Claude Code. I
watched a video on YouTube almost right after it came out in February 2025,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJpK3YTTKZ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJpK3YTTKZ4</a>, and I immediately saw that Claude
Code could be very powerful, but I didn’t actually jump in and try it. It still
seemed maybe “not for me” as I had my Avante.nvim integration.</p>
<p>However, I think once I saw Gemini CLI get released, I was like, ok I should try
that out. The Gemini CLI has a free tier. Gemini CLI did ok, but it seemed not
quite as powerful as Claude. I had also already used Claude via the Avante.nvim
integration, so I switched to Claude Code</p>
<p>I started making Claude Code do very challenging tasks, and it was quite
successful on many of them. One of the most mindboggling things it has done to
date for me, and there are many, is that it completely reached into a very
complex codebase called Bandage, a C++ codebase, and managed to compile it
usimng emscripten to WASM and use it in Javascript. This produced
<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/bandagejs">https://github.com/cmdcolin/bandagejs</a> It is a demo that I still need to work on,
but I was pretty mindblown by this</p>
<h2 id="switching-from-api-billing-to-subscription">Switching from API billing to subscription</h2>
<p>I am not a big fan of subscriptions, but I also started burning through a lot of
API tokens. I’m talking like…it burned through 50+ bucks to do that bandageJS
project even though it only did it in a couple hours</p>
<p>The cost was high, but at the same time it would literally make breakthroughs
that I would (likely) never have done. To try to bring ‘down the cost’ I decided
to change to a subscription at some point.</p>
<p>I bought the basic 20 dollar tier of Claude, and ran out of it immediately. Then
I upgraded to Claude Max and now am at 100 bucks a month. That’s where I am
“happily” sitting now.</p>
<p>I can sometimes ‘max out’ the Claude Max tier but it is probably the right level
for me. This is a weird thing to ‘confess’ but I buy the subscription myself,
and do not get it re-imbursed through my work. Might need to have that talk at
some point with my boss.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-use-claude-code">How I use Claude Code</h2>
<h3 id="running-multiple-claude-code-sessions-at-once">Running multiple Claude Code sessions at once</h3>
<p>I frequently have 2-3 Claude Code sessions going in different terminals, and I
assign them distinct tasks</p>
<p>I have seen some people use ‘git worktrees’ to enable parallel Claude Code
sessions, but I generally just use multiple separate clones of the repo</p>
<p>This is a little chaotic on the brain, as you have to mentally juggle multiple
distinct tasks, but it let’s you literally solve like…2-3x the bugs</p>
<h3 id="telling-claude-code-to-simplify-and-refactor-repeatedly">Telling Claude Code to simplify and refactor repeatedly</h3>
<p>After almost every question, I will ask it something like “now that we have a
working system, are there any simplifications or refactorings that you would
make”</p>
<p>Maybe there is more optimial wording but in general it can identify some
reasonable simplifications that are good-to-have</p>
<h3 id="telling-claude-code-to-find-optimizations">Telling Claude Code to find optimizations</h3>
<p>I work with ‘big data’, and being fast is important. A lot of the optimizations
that Claude Code recommends do not move the needle at all, but if you set up a
benchmark, as I wrote about previously
<a href="https://cmdcolin.github.io/posts/2025-11-24-simplebench/">https://cmdcolin.github.io/posts/2025-11-24-simplebench/</a> you can start to
measurably achieve speed improvements</p>
<h3 id="telling-claude-code-to-vendor-entire-npm-packages-and-make-new-modifications-or-simplifications">Telling Claude Code to vendor entire NPM packages, and make new modifications or simplifications</h3>
<p>Our app uses a variety of NPM packages, and some of them are quite old by now.
Sometimes this doesn’t really matter, but when you start to ‘ossify’ and you can
only use version 1.0.x of some package because of reason Y, it is really
annoying. You can ask Claude Code to literally vendor the entire package, make
bugfixes or improvements, update it to use typescript, remove unused
functionality, and more</p>
<p>I read this essay sometime in 2025 and it was mildly influential on me:
<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/vendoring/">https://htmx.org/essays/vendoring/</a></p>
<p>I am a big fan of using libraries, but this is getting threatened by both AI
usage being able to generate bespoke solutions (xref
<a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/11/16/the-fate-of-small-open-source/">https://nolanlawson.com/2025/11/16/the-fate-of-small-open-source/</a>) and the
threat of using libraries with giant hacks like Shai-Halud
(<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/09/23/widespread-supply-chain-compromise-impacting-npm-ecosystem">https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/09/23/widespread-supply-chain-compromise-impacting-npm-ecosystem</a>)</p>
<p>The reality though is you are now responsible for maintaining this ‘dependency’
yourself but over time you basically do battle with almost every dependency you
take on at some level</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>This is only a brief snapshot into my Claude Code usage. This new AI coding
world is scary, exciting, dystopian…it’s a lot</p>
<p>AI coding is a superpower you can use, but it is also a superpower your
competition can use to leapfrog you and your work… so much AI usage is
derivative drivel that rips off what others do which is sad. We should think
carefully about how we can uniquely add value with what we work on</p>
<p>In any event…Good luck out there, and happy holidays</p>
<h2 id="footnote-1">Footnote 1</h2>
<p>The complete anti-AI sentiment on reddit, combined with increasing AI generated
text on reddit, along with increasing ragebait and engagement bait BS made me
completely quit social media in 2025. I just watch random youtubes now if I need
a dopamine hit. I feel bad that I won’t be able to help out random strangers
that are asking questions now, but I have more time to</p>
<h2 id="footnote-2">Footnote 2</h2>
<p>This was also a little bit of a harbinger of things to come. When the AI is not
working…or you run out of tokens…you don’t have the wind behind your sails
