e:T2524,<p>Complaining about spammers is kind of a futile endeavor, and in this case, it
even seems that there are people behind it which kinda makes me feel bad to
complain about it, but I keep seeing this spam-type substance on my sacred
forums.</p>
<p>Many of these posts come from a blog called devinterrupted. They post things
related to "engineering management" type topics. And, they often "hit a chord"
and get highly upvoted and replied to. It's often the type of thing everyone can
add their two cents on, or offload some steam. One person called it engagement
spam and that seems about right.</p>
<p>This wouldn't all be so bad, but it is sometimes posted with formulaic titles,
created by sock puppet accounts and promoting a specific company (linearB). I
gathered as many posts from them as I can, helpfully grouped into clickbait-y
categories.</p>
<p>Update 2023-01-06: a Reddit user reached out to me who is quite knowledgeable
about astroturfing campaigns and confirmed my suspicions here that it's all sock
puppet accounts</p>

<p>The devinterrupted blog/podcast appears to be related to the linearB company,
who advocate a notion of "cycle time" (<a href="https://linearb.io/blog/cycle-time/">https://linearb.io/blog/cycle-time/</a>) as a
developer metric engineering managers should look at. They interview some
interesting people but someone referred to it as "engagement spam". They promote
the "gitStream" product on all the posts on devinterrupted.
<a href="https://linearb.io/dev/gitstream/">https://linearb.io/dev/gitstream/</a></p>
<p>Update 2023: I would bet the "contextkeeper" blog is related because some
sockpuppet accounts are posting from both blogs</p>
<p>I'd recommend linearB stop posting these things, or pretending that they are not
behind these posts.</p>6:["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:w-1/2","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"The devinterrupted'ening of /r/programming"}],["$","h4",null,{"children":"2022-12-27"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$e"}}],["$","$Lf",null,{}]]}]
