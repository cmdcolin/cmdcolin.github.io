8:T1969,<p>I started this post to try to talk about things that make me happy. It's not
really a happiness though that I wanted to talk about, it's just about living
life...sometimes it's a struggle and that can be rewarding also. So here are
some photos of everyday things</p>

<p>sunset from backyard. my house is adjacent to an "abandoned" golf course so it's
just a big open space</p>

<p>a dog named remy i saw at the dog park visiting parents. remy has a funny habit
of herding other dogs around</p>

<p>my parents dogs zoe (right) and tux (left). my parents walk them everyday and
it's great to join them</p>

<p>the place I live is a house that we rent. unfortunately and the owners are
letting the place fall apart due to leaks in the roof</p>

<p>making a drip irrigation system for my weird garden. the sunrise timer was
particularly funny. I put the battery pack in backwards and it didn't work, and
took it apart to fully understand the mechanism (had to see how the battery
contacts touched the inside of the system to see it)</p>
