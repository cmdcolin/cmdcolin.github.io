I charted these\noutput times, before and after we increased the memory limits of tomcat, and it\nturned out that the response time of the webapp was dramatically improved by\nthis change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/131229569383_0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1. The webapp response time was extremely variable before the redeploy on\nOct 2nd where we increased tomcat's memory allocation, which thereafter\ndramatically improved the response time.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the webapp response time was being severely compromised by the memory\nissues.</p>\n<p>In response to all of these issues, I also added GC logging to the tomcat\nconfiguration so that I can see if the GC is correlated with these webapp\nresponse time. Figure 2 shows how high GC activity is correlated with longer\nwebapp response times, but note that this figure was made after the other memory\nallocation problems were fixed, so it is still much better than the problems we\nhad in the past.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/131229569383_1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2. After increasing the memory, you can see webapp response time is much\nbetter, except if the GC activity becomes very high, and then this increases the\nresponse time.</p>\n<p>Edit: Bonus screenshot, seemingly each friday we get a majoy activity burst that\ntriggers GC activity!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/131229569383_2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3.

If you can afford to get more memory to allocate to tomcat,\nthen it's probably a good idea.</p>\n<p>Also, tracking your webapp response times will help you see if your changes are\nhaving a good effect. I made this a script for graphing log outputs here\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cmdcolin/loggraph\">https://github.com/cmdcolin/loggraph</a></p>\n<p>PS:</p>\n<p>If your tomcat is running as the tomcat user, then it can be difficult to debug\nthe memory problems simply with the \"get heap dump\" from jvisualvm, because the\npermissions will be wrong. To fix this, try using a privileged user to run the\njmap command:</p>\n<pre><code>runuser -l tomcat -c \"/usr/java/latest/bin/jmap-dump:format=b,file=/db/tomcat/tomcat.dump 25543\"\n</code></pre>"}}],["$","$L9",null,{}]]}]
