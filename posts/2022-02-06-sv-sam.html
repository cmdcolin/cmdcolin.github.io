<a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf">https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf</a> but it is also fairly terse and
abstract. True understanding might come from playing with real world data, but
I will try to relay some things I have learned, especially as they relate to
structural variants.</p><p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a developer of JBrowse 2. This document has some screenshots
and links for it, feel free to try it at <a href="https://jbrowse.org">https://jbrowse.org</a></p><p>Also note: When I refer to a <code>SAM</code> record in this document, it could come from
a <code>SAM</code>, <code>BAM</code>, or <code>CRAM</code> file as <code>BAM</code> and <code>CRAM</code> are just alternative
encodings of <code>SAM</code></p><h2>Basics</h2><h3>What is a <code>SAM</code> file and how does it relate to <code>BAM</code> and <code>CRAM</code>?</h3><p>A <code>SAM</code> file contains &quot;reads&quot; from a sequencer. The raw unaligned reads are
often stored in <code>FASTQ</code> format files. The reads from <code>FASTQ</code> format are then
inputted into an aligner such as <code>bwa</code>, <code>bowtie</code>, <code>minimap2</code> (there are many
others) which map the reads to a reference genome, and output <code>SAM</code> format.</p><p><code>SAM</code> is a text format that you can read with your text editor. <code>BAM</code> and
<code>CRAM</code> are compressed representations of the <code>SAM</code> format.</p><p>You can convert <code>SAM</code> to <code>BAM</code> with samtools</p><p><code>samtools view file.sam -o file.bam</code></p><p>A slightly modified command converts <code>SAM</code> to <code>CRAM</code> (requires -T argument to
specify your reference sequence)</p><p><code>samtools view -T reference.fa file.sam -o file.cram</code></p><p>Also see Appendix C: piping FASTQ from <code>minimap2</code> directly to CRAM</p><h3>What is in a <code>SAM</code> file</h3><p>A <code>SAM</code> file contains a header (<code>BAM</code> and <code>CRAM</code> files also have the <code>SAM</code>
header) and a series of records. A record is a single line in a <code>SAM</code> file, and
it generally corresponds to a single read, but as we will see, a split
alignment may produce multiple records that refer to the same source read.</p><p>Note: you can also store unaligned data in <code>SAM</code>/<code>BAM</code>/<code>CRAM</code> (so-called <code>uBAM</code>
for example) but most of the time, the reads in <code>SAM</code> format are aligned to a
reference genome.</p><p>Also note: if a read failed to align to the reference genome, it may still be
in your <code>SAM</code> file, marked as unmapped using the flag column. Sometimes,
&quot;dumpster diving&quot; (looking at the unmapped records from a <code>SAM</code> file) can be
used to aid structural variant searches (e.g. there may be novel sequence in
there not from the reference genome that could be assembled)</p><h3>What is a <code>CIGAR</code> string</h3><p>A <code>CIGAR</code> string is a &quot;compact idiosyncratic gapped alignment report&quot;. Yes,
that&#x27;s an acronym.</p><p>Examples of <code>CIGAR</code> strings</p><ul><li><p>A <code>CIGAR</code> strings could look be <code>50M</code> which means 50 bases &quot;matched&quot;. There
are no insertions or deletions. There could be underlying mismatches in this
sequence that only comparing to a reference sequence would tell you</p></li><li><p>Another <code>CIGAR</code> string with insertions and deletions could be <code>50M1D1I50M</code>.
This string had a deletion and an insertion back to back. This could be just
a mismatch! There is ambiguity in sequence alignment representations.
Downstream programs must accomodate this.</p></li><li><p>Another <code>CIGAR</code> string with soft-clipping <code>500S50M</code> this means that 500 bases
of the read were not aligned at this position, but 50 bases were! Note that
the alignment might have been a split alignment (see seciton on split
alignments below) so another record in the <code>SAM</code> file might contain info on
where the other 500 bases aligned, or they might just be fully unaligned.</p></li></ul><p>See SAMv1.pdf for all the CIGAR operators.</p><p>And also: ♫ don&#x27;t fear the <code>CIGAR</code> ♫</p><p>If you are working with <code>SAM</code> data, you will often write loops that directly
parse CIGAR strings. See Appendix B for handy functions for parsing <code>CIGAR</code>
strings.</p><h3>What is an <code>MD</code> string</h3><p>An <code>MD</code> string is a tag in <code>SAM</code> file that helps tell you where the mismatches
are, and can be combined with a <code>CIGAR</code> to get the position of the mismatches
without looking at a reference genome.</p><p>The <code>MD</code> string is commonly seen in <code>BAM</code> files (not generally <code>CRAM</code> because
it already uses reference compression and requires a reference sequence to
decode). The <code>MD</code> tag contains information about deletions (including the bases
of the reference genome, which would otherwise not be indicated) and mismatches
(same, indicating the base of the reference genome at a SNPs position), but not
insertions.</p><p>The command <code>samtools calmd yourfile.bam --reference reference.fa</code> can add <code>MD</code>
tags to your <code>BAM</code> file. Note that there are some oddities about <code>MD</code> tags
leading to complaints (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/issues/505">https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/issues/505</a>)
but the <code>MD</code> tag can be helpful if you want to decode a file without referring
to it&#x27;s reference.</p><h2>Detecting SVs from long reads</h2><p>Long reads offer a wide array of methods for detecting SVs</p><ul><li>Insertions/deletions: Long reads can completely span moderate sized
insertions and deletions, indicated by <code>I</code> or <code>D</code> in a <code>CIGAR</code> string. If it
does not completely span it, it may be split alignment (for a deletion) or
clipped (for an insertion)</li><li>Translocations: A split alignment can span inter-chromosomal translocations,
so part of the read maps to one chromosome and one part maps to the other</li><li>Inversions: A split alignment can span an inversion, the long read is split
into multiple parts, one part of it aligns in the reverse orientation, while
the other part aligns in the forward orientation</li></ul><p>Note that there are many different methods for detecting SVs from long reads,
e.g. not all use mapped reads from SAM files, some use de novo assembly, but
it is still useful to be familiar with mapped read methods.</p><h3>What are split alignments?</h3><p>Split alignments, or chimeric alignments, are alignments where part of the read
aligns to perhaps chr1, and part of it maps to perhaps chr4. It is worth
reading the definition of &quot;Chimeric alignment&quot; from
<a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf">SAMv1.pdf</a> when you get the
chance.</p><p>Split alignments are especially common with long reads, and it can indicate
that there may be a structural variant where the two chromosomes are fused
together (which may create gene fusions, or other types of phenomena).</p><p>There is no limitation on how many splits might occur so the split can align to
3, 4, or more different places. Each part of the split puts a new line in the
SAM file, and note that all the records also have the same <code>QNAME</code> (first
column of <code>SAM</code>). As
<a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf">SAMv1.pdf</a> tells us, one
record is marked as &quot;representative&quot;, I call this the &quot;primary&quot; record, while
the other components of the split read are maked supplementary, given the 2048
flag. Only the &quot;primary&quot; record generally has a <code>SEQ</code> field.</p><p>Note: split alignments are different from &quot;multi-mappers&quot; where the entire read
maps maps equally well to, say, chr4 and chr1. Split reads maps part to chr1,
and part to chr4. See again the
<a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf">SAMv1.pdf</a> for the definition
of multi-mapping</p><h3>What is the <code>SA</code> tag?</h3><p>The <code>SA</code> tag is outputted on each part of the split alignment, e.g. the primary
contains an <code>SA</code> tag that refers to all the locations, <code>CIGAR</code> strings, and
more for all the supplementary reads, and each of the supplementary reads also
contains an <code>SA</code> tag that refers to the primary alignment and each other
supplementary alignment.</p><p>Fun fact: The <code>SA</code> tag conceptually can result in a &#x27;quadratic explosion&#x27; of
data, because each part of the split contains references to every other part.
For example, if a read is split into 4 pieces, then each record would would
have an SA tag with 3 segments, so 3<!-- -->*<!-- -->4 segments will be documented in the<code>SA</code>
tag. In many cases, this is not a problem, but if you imagine a finished
chromosome aligned to a draft assembly, it may get split so many times this
could be a factor.</p><h3>Visualizing split reads across a breakend or translocation</h3><p>This is a specialized JBrowse 2 feature, but if there is an inter-chromosomal
translocation, you can load this into JBrowse and visualize support for this
event using our &quot;breakpoint split view&quot;. This</p><p>We also have a workflow called the &quot;SV inspector&quot; that helps you setup the
&quot;breakpoint split views&quot;
(<a href="https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/user_guide/#sv-inspector">https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/user_guide/#sv-inspector</a>). The SV inspector works
best on Breakend spec events and <!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->TRA<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> (translocation) events from VCF,
or BEDPE formatted SV calls, and you can launch the &quot;breakpoint split view&quot;
from the &quot;SV inspector&quot;</p><p><img src="/media/breakpoint_split_view.png"/></p><h3>Visualizing a &#x27;read vs reference&#x27; view given a split alignment</h3><p>If we are given the the primary alignment of an arbitrary split read, then we
can construct what that split looks like compared to the reference genome.</p><p>If we are not given the primary alignment (e.g. we are starting from a
supplementary alignment) then we can search the <code>SA</code> list for the one that is
primary, because at least one will be.</p><p>Now that we have the primary alignment, it will have the <code>SEQ</code> (of the entire
read, the supplementary alignments typically have a blank <code>SEQ</code>!) and the <code>SA</code>
tag containing the <code>CIGAR</code> of all the different parts of the split. We can then
construct how the entire read, not just a particular record of the split
alignment, compares to the genome. In JBrowse 2 we implemented this and it uses
a synteny-style rendering. This functionality also exists in GenomeRibbon
(<a href="https://genomeribbon.org">https://genomeribbon.org</a>)</p><p><img src="/media/linear_alignment.png"/></p><p>Figure showing JBrowse 2 piecing together a long read vs the reference genome
from a single read</p><p>In order to do this reconstruction, JBrowse 2 takes the <code>CIGAR</code> strings of the
primary alignment and each of the pieces of the <code>SA</code> tag (it is a semi-colon
separated list of chunks), sort them by the amount of softclipping (the
softclipping values will progressively trim off more of the <code>SEQ</code> telling you
it aligned further and further on in the long read), and then this tells me
where each piece of the split alignment came from in the original <code>SEQ</code>, so we
can plot the alignments of the read vs the reference genome using synteny style
display.</p><h3>SAM vs VCF - Breakends vs split alignments</h3><p>An interesting outcome (to me) is that from a single record in a <code>SAM</code> file, I
can reconstruct the &quot;derived&quot; genome around a region of interest from a single
read.</p><p>If I was to try to do this with the <code>VCF</code> Breakend specification (section 5.4
of <a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf">VCF4.3.pdf</a>), it may
actually be more challenging than from a <code>SAM</code> read. This is because a Breakend
in <code>VCF</code> format is only an edge in a graph (and the sequences are nodes).
Therefore, in order to properly reconstruct a structural variant from a <code>VCF</code>
with Breakends, I would have to construct a graph and decode paths through it.</p><p>I like the ability to reconstruct the derived genome from a single read, but it
can be noisy. That said, de novo assembled contigs can also be stored in <code>SAM</code>
format and is significantly less noisy (being composed of the aggregate
information of many reads).</p><p>The point though is that interpretation of the <code>VCF</code> breakend specification is
challenging due to imposing a sequence graph on the genome, while the <code>SA</code> tag
remains just a simple set of linear alignments that can easily be pieced
together, and you only need to refer to a single record in the <code>SAM</code> file to do
so.</p><p>I am not aware of a lot of tools that work on the VCF Breakend graph, and
expect more will need to be created to truly work with this standard. An
inversion for example may create 4 record in the VCF file (see section 5.4 in
the <a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf">VCF4.3.pdf</a> for
example), and needs careful interpretation.</p><h3>Haplotype tagged reads</h3><p>A new trend has been to create <code>SAM</code>/<code>BAM</code>/<code>CRAM</code> files with tagged reads,
which tells us which haplotype a read was inferred to have come from. This is
commonly done with the <code>HP</code> tag, which might have <code>HP=0</code> and <code>HP=1</code> for a
diploid genome. Tools like <code>whatshap</code> can add these tags to a <code>SAM</code> file, and
IGV and JBrowse 2 can color and sort by these tags.</p><p><img src="/media/color_by_tag.png"/></p><p>Screenshot of JBrowse 2 with the &quot;Color by tag&quot; and &quot;Sort by tag&quot; setting
enabled (coloring and sorting by the HP tag) letting us see that only one
haplotype has a deletion. Tutorial for how to do this in JBrowse 2 here
<a href="https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/user_guide/#sort-color-and-filter-by-tag">https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/user_guide/#sort-color-and-filter-by-tag</a></p><h2>How do you detect SVs with paired-end reads?</h2><p>Paired-end reads are short reads, e.g. 150bp each. This makes them unable to
recover some large structural variants.</p><p>However, paired-end reads have a number of attributes that can be used to
detect paired end reads</p><h3>Distance between pairs being abnormally large or short</h3><p>The distance between pairs is encoded by the <code>TLEN</code> column in the <code>SAM</code> format.
The distance between pairs with good mapping is relatively constant and called
the &quot;insert length&quot;. This comes from how the sequencing is done: paired-end
sequencing performs sequencing on both ends of a fragment.</p><p>But, if you are mapping reads vs the reference genome, and you observe that
they are abnormally far apart, say 50kb apart instead of 1kb apart, this may
indicate there your sample contains a deletion relative to the reference.</p><p><img src="/media/aberrant_size.png"/></p><p>Screenshot of JBrowse 1 with &quot;View as pairs&quot; enabled, and large insert size
colored as red (from <a href="https://jbrowse.org/docs/paired_reads.html">https://jbrowse.org/docs/paired_reads.html</a>). Note that
some of JBrowse 1&#x27;s View as pairs features are not yet available in JBrowse 2</p><h3>An abundance of reads being &quot;clipped&quot; at a particular position</h3><p>This can indicate that part of the reads map well, but then there was an abrupt
stop to the mapping. This might mean that there is a sequence that was an
insertion at that position, or a deletion, or a translocation.</p><p>The clipping is indicated by the <code>CIGAR</code> string, either at the start or end of
it by an <code>S</code> or an <code>H</code>. The <code>S</code> indicates &quot;soft clipping&quot;, and indicates that
the sequence of the clipped portion can be found in the <code>SEQ</code> field of the
primary alignment. The <code>H</code> is hard clipped, and the sequence that is hard
clipped will not appear in the <code>SEQ</code>.</p><p><img src="/media/clipping_pileup.png"/></p><p>Screenshot of JBrowse 2 showing blue clipping indicator with a &quot;pileup&quot; of
soft-clipping at a particular position shown in blue. The clipping is an
&quot;interbase&quot; operation (it occurs between base pair coordinates) so it is
plotted separately from the normal coverage histogram.</p><p><img src="/media/show_soft_clipping.png"/></p><p>Screenshot of JBrowse 2 showing an insertion with Nanopore (top), PacBio
(middle) and Illumina short reads. The long reads may completely span the
insertion, so the CIGAR string on those have an <code>I</code> operator and are indicated
by the purple triangle above the reads. For the short reads, the reads near the
insertion will be clipped since they will not properly map to the reference
genome and cannot span the sinsertion. The &quot;Show soft clipping&quot; setting in
JBrowse 2 and IGV can be used to show visually the bases that extend into the
insertion (shown on the bottom track).</p><h3>Unexpected pair orientation</h3><p>With standard paired end sequencing, the pairs normally point at each other</p><pre><code>forward reverse
 ---&gt;    &lt;---
</code></pre><p>If the stranded-ness of the pair is off, then it could indicate a structural
variant. See Appendix A for a handy function for calculating pair orientation.</p><p>This guide from IGV is helpful for interpreting the pair directionality with
patterns of SVs using &quot;Color by pair orientation&quot;</p><p><a href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/interpreting_pair_orientations">https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/interpreting_pair_orientations</a></p><p><img src="/media/inverted_duplication.png"/></p><p>Figure: This shows an inverted (tandem) duplication in 1000 genomes data. The
tandem duplication can produce green arrows which have reads pointing in
opposite directions e.g. <code>&lt;--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>, while blue arrows which can indicate
an inversion point in the same direction e.g. <code>--&gt;</code> and <code>--&gt;</code></p><h3>Caveat about TLEN</h3><p>Note that <code>TLEN</code> is a field in the SAM format that is somewhat ill defined,
at least in the sense that different tools may use it differently
<a href="https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam/issues/667#issuecomment-381521767">https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam/issues/667#issuecomment-381521767</a></p><p>If needed, you can calculate <code>TLEN</code> yourself if you process the file yourself
(e.g. process all reads, get the actual records for the pairs, and calculate
distance) but I have not had trouble with relying on the <code>TLEN</code> from the data
files themselves.</p><h2>Calling copy number variants with your short or long reads</h2><p>Another type of SV that you can get from your <code>SAM</code> files are copy number
variants (CNVs). By looking at the depth-of-coverage for your data files, you
can look for abnormalities that may indicate copy number variants. By using a
tool like <code>mosdepth</code>, you can quickly get a file showing the coverage across
the genome.</p><p>Be aware that if you are comparing the coverage counts from different tools,
that they have different defaults that may affect comparison. Some discard
<code>QC_FAIL</code>, <code>DUP</code>, and <code>SECONDARY</code> flagged reads. This is probably appropriate,
and corresponds to what most genome browsers will display (see
<a href="https://gist.github.com/cmdcolin/9f677eca28448d8a7c5d6e9917fc56af">https://gist.github.com/cmdcolin/9f677eca28448d8a7c5d6e9917fc56af</a> for a short
summary of depth calculated from different tools)</p><p>Note that both long and short reads can be used for CNV detection. Long reads
may give more accurate measurements also, with their better ability to map
smoothly through difficult regions of the genome.</p><p><img src="/media/coverage_cnv.png"/></p><p>Screenshot showing coverage in BigWig format from nanopore reads on normal and

and

reference genome (and the SAM format is a signature of this: it stores data in
terms of reference genome coordinates). In the future, SV visualization may
look more similar to comparative genomics, where we compare an SV to a
population specific reference from a graph genomes or something like this.</p><p>It is known that de-novo assembly has more power to detect SVs than some read
operations (<a href="https://twitter.com/lh3lh3/status/1362921612690010118/photo/1">https://twitter.com/lh3lh3/status/1362921612690010118/photo/1</a>) so
as de novo assembled genomes improve and become more widespread, we may see a
shift in how SVs are called</p><p>I would also like to see improved ability to do fast or &#x27;on the fly&#x27; gene
prediction on the de novo assembled genomes, and we can see what SNPs or
modified splicing might occur in CNV copies of genes.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Algorithms that actually call structural variants face many challenges, but
understanding how the reads are encoded in SAM format, and seeing what they
look like in the genome browser is a useful first step to gaining a better
understanding.</p><p>In summary, some of the signatures of SVs may include:</p><ul><li>Aberrant insert size (<code>TLEN</code>) detection (longer for deletion, shorter for
insertion)</li><li>Split-read detection (<code>SA</code> tag)</li><li>CIGAR string processing (<code>D</code> operator for deletions, <code>I</code> operator for
insertions)</li><li>Over-abundance of clipping (<code>S</code> or <code>H</code> operators in <code>CIGAR</code>)</li><li>Depth of coverage changes for CNVs</li><li>Aligning de novo assembly vs a reference genome

output <code>SAM</code>, but it can also output
<a href="https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md"><code>PAF</code></a> format (which can
be loaded in JBrowse 2 in the synteny views). Techniques of detecting SVs on
PAF will be fundamentally pretty similar to the techniques listed above but
may look a bit different (see <code>cs</code> tag in PAF for example)</li></ul><p>If you have any ideas I should include here, let me know!</p><h3>Appendix A: Parsing CIGAR strings</h3><p>This is code that can help determine the pair orientation from a single BAM
