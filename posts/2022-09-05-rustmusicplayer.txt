I stepped to using <code>gtk4-rs</code> directly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-spreadsheet-style-data-grid-of-tracks-with-columnview\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#create-a-spreadsheet-style-data-grid-of-tracks-with-columnview\"><a href=\"#create-a-spreadsheet-style-data-grid-of-tracks-with-columnview\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Create a \"spreadsheet style\" data grid of tracks with <code>ColumnView</code></h3>\n<p>Then, I wanted to create a data grid showing to display e.g. a table with\nartist, track, album, etc. I chose to use the GTK\n<a href=\"https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ColumnView.html\"><code>ColumnView</code></a> to drive this. I\nstumbled around looking for example code, but there was none specifically for\nthe <code>ColumnView</code>. I also realized the <code>ListView</code> example from the <code>gtk4-rs</code>\nexamples with it's factory function had similar needs that the <code>ColumnView</code>.</p>\n<p>I found out that I basically needed to create a <code>ListStore</code>. I thought if I\ncould make my own <code>GObject</code> subclass, it would solve everything, but I had\ntrouble getting making this work (rust doesn't have the concept of extending a\nclass for one thing, you implement various traits instead). Finally, I randomly\nstumbled on this link using a <code>BoxedAnyObject</code> with a good example of storing\ndata in a ListStore\n<a href=\"https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html\">https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html</a></p>\n<p>The <code>BoxedAnyObject</code> is a <code>GObject</code>, so this was an good route to storing the\n<code>ListView</code> items. There was no example code for connecting the <code>ListStore</code> with\nthe <code>ColumnView</code>, so I stuggled for awhile before realizing that the <code>ListView</code>\nexample in the <code>gtk4-rs</code> codebase has similar concepts.</p>\n<p>See [1] for minimal usage of <code>ColumnView</code> that I contributed to the <code>gtk4-rs</code>\nrepo!</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosing-an-audio-library\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#choosing-an-audio-library\"><a href=\"#choosing-an-audio-library\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Choosing an audio library</h3>\n<p>To actually play audio, I looked at a couple options. There was even one option\ncalled GTK\n<a href=\"https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gtk4/struct.MediaFile.html\"><code>MediaFile</code></a>\nwhich should to be able to play e.g. mp3s, making my job of making a media\nplayer much simpler, but it produced an error\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;oq=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57.267j0j7&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8\">\"GTK could not find a media module. Check your installation.\"</a>\nwhich had very few references on the internet. I figured this could be difficult\nto solve or point to issues I could face later on making minimal executables for\nusers.</p>\n<p>So, next I tried out <code>symphonia</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/\">https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/</a>).\nSymphonia requires a lot more code to work (~1000 lines so far, copying from the\n<code>symphonia-play</code> example) but it has broad file format support, pure-rust audio\nstack, etc. I got confused about how to package it into an easy-to-use system\nthough, having to create a symphonia player on a separate thread, so I looked\nelsewhere...</p>\n<p>Next I turned to <code>rodio</code>. This works well, and automatically plays on a separate\nthread, but I found two issues 1) I have to initialize the rodio player in \"fn\nmain\" and not anywhere else, or it would just play a short blip of audio\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/381\">https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/381</a>). Then, it turned out that the\n<code>rodio</code>\n<a href=\"https://docs.rs/rodio/0.14.0/rodio/struct.Sink.html#method.stop\"><code>Sink</code></a>\ninstance (which you pass audio to) cannot stop and then play new song xref\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/315\">https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/315</a>). To workaround, I replace it\nwith a new <code>Sink</code>.</p>\n<p>This required me to learn about <code>RefCell</code>. I googled probably about 50 things\njust grasping at straws for awhile, but then landed on the solution of putting\nthe <code>Sink</code> in a <code>Rc&#x3C;RefCell&#x3C;Sink>></code>, then that allows me to pass it into my\ncallback that handles double clicking the songs in the <code>ColumnView</code>, and then I\nborrow the <code>RefCell</code> mutably to replace it with a new <code>Sink</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reading-audio-metadata-into-an-sqlite-db\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#reading-audio-metadata-into-an-sqlite-db\"><a href=\"#reading-audio-metadata-into-an-sqlite-db\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Reading audio metadata into an <code>sqlite</code> DB</h3>\n<p>I also wanted to have the option of reading and writing audio metadata.\nSymphonia only reads metadata, so I found the <code>lofty</code> crate.</p>\n<p>I also realized that reading tens of thousands of file's metadata at each app\nstartup would be slow, so I endeavored to store that data in an <code>sqlite</code>\ndatabase. I found that music players like <code>foobar2000</code> and <code>0xdeadbeef</code> have\ndatabases of track metadata also (Example folder on <code>foobar2000</code> (1.x) for this\nsnap/foobar2000/433/foobar2000/profile/library/74E45640B1C695CC/meta-0001,\nmeta-0002, etc.)</p>\n<p>I used the <code>walkdir</code> crate to walk a directory for files, <code>lofty</code> to read the\nmetadata, and then finally inserted the data into the <code>sqlite</code> db.
