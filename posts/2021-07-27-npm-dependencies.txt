d:T74f,<p>You are writing a library...or you are writing an app and you want to publish
some of the components of it as a library...</p>
<p>Here are some questions in the form of comments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did you realize that your yarn.lock will be ignored for anyone who installs
your libraries?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you realize this means that your perfectly running test suite with your
yarn.lock could be a failing case for consumers of your library unless you
don’t use semver strings like ^1.0.0 and just hardcode it to 1.0.0?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you realize the default of ^1.0.0 automatically gets minor version bumps
which are often fairly substantial changes, e.g. even breaking possibly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you know that larger libraries like @material-ui/core don’t like to bump
their major version all the time for example so large changes are often made
to the minor version?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you know if you run <code>yarn upgrade</code>, it may update what is in your
yarn.lock file but will not update what is in your package.json?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you realize that this means that if you depend on the results of running
<code>yarn upgrade</code> e.g. it gave you a bugfix, you could be shipping buggy code to
consumers of your library?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just something to be aware of! You can always ride the dragon and accept these
minor breakages from semver bumps, but it can introduce some issues for your
consumers</p>
<p>Random fun thing: Adding a yarn package can even downgrade some other packages.
For example if you have ^6.0.0 in your package.json, you yarn upgrade it so in
the lockfile it says 6.1.0 but then later install another library that requires
a hard 6.0.1, yarn will decide to downgrade you to 6.0.1 (it will not have a
duplicate entry in yarn.lock, just that the 6.1.0 in the yarn.lock will
downgrade to 6.0.1)</p>5:["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:w-1/2 m-auto","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Do you understand your NPM dependencies?"}],["$","h4",null,{"children":"2021-07-27"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$d"}}],["$","$Le",null,{}]]}]
