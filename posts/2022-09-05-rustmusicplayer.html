I did the rustlings exercises but I
knew the concepts would fade rapidly from my brain without some practice. I
have now started making a music player using Rust+GTK4.</p>
<p>I chose GTK4 is to have a linux native GUI to scratch the itch that I've had in
lacking foobar2000 on linux. I have a particular foobar2000 setup that uses
default UI with four quadrants. I have used foobar2000 under wine and it's not
terrible, but it has background CPU consumption of about 14% idle and is just a
little "off". I have also used a variety of other GUI (quodlibet) and CLI
(cmus) apps on linux, but they didn't really feel quite right.</p>

<p>I started by attempting with Relm4, which I may return to at some point, but
trying to juggle learning Relm4-style widgets, GTK, and rust all at once was a
bit much. I stepped to using gtk4-rs directly.</p>

<p>Then, I wanted to create a data grid showing to display e.g. a table with
artist, track, album, etc. I chose to use the
<a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ColumnView.html">Gtk::ColumnView</a> to drive
this. I stumbled around looking for example code, but there was none
specifically for the ColumnView. Soon, I realized the ListView example from the
gtk4-rs examples with it's factory function was similar in concept.</p>

<p>Then, I wanted to get the data for the songs into a ListStore, but I thought if
I could make my own GObject subclass, it would solve everything, but I had
trouble getting this. Finally, I randomly stumbled on this link using a
BoxedAnyObject with a good example of storing data in a ListStore
<a href="https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html">https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html</a></p>
<p>The BoxedAnyObject is a GObject, so my troubles got automatically solved
essentially</p>

<p>There was no example code for this so I stuggled with this (for a couple
days) before realizing that the ListView example in the gtk4-rs codebase has
similar concepts (factory to create grid cells, etc). I created a PR
(<a href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/pull/1111">https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/pull/1111</a>) to demonstrate simple ColumnView
usage.</p>
<p>After this hurdle was crossed, I felt much more comfortable in the GTK mindset,
and I quickly fleshed out some more UI for the app</p>

<p>I would just search for various components and they often already existed which
was great. There was even one called Gtk::MediaFile which should to be able to
play e.g. mp3s, making my job of making a media player much simpler, but it
produced an error <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;oq=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57.267j0j7&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8">"GTK could not find a media module.

which had very few references on the internet. So, I am trying out symphonia
(<a href="https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/">https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/</a>), with the hope being that it is
easier to package these for consumers of the app.</p>
