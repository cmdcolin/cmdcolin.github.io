<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54452896/maximum-number-of-entries-in-node-js-map">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54452896/maximum-number-of-entries-in-node-js-map</a></p><pre><code>V8 developer here. I can confirm that 2^24 is the maximum number of entries in
a Map. That’s not a bug, it’s just the implementation-defined limit.

The limit is determined by:

The FixedArray backing store of the Map has a maximum size of 1GB (independent
of the overall heap size limit) On a 64-bit system that means 1GB / 8B = 2^30 /
2^3 = 2^27 ~= 134M maximum elements per FixedArray A Map needs 3 elements per
entry (key, value, next bucket link), and has a maximum load factor of 50% (to
avoid the slowdown caused by many bucket collisions), and its capacity must be
a power of 2. 2^27 / (3 * 2) rounded down to the next power of 2 is 2^24, which
is the limit you observe.  FWIW, there are limits to everything: besides the
maximum heap size, there’s a maximum String length, a maximum Array length, a
maximum ArrayBuffer length, a maximum BigInt size, a maximum stack size, etc.
Any one of those limits is potentially debatable, and sometimes it makes sense
to raise them, but the limits as such will remain. Off the top of my head I
don’t know what it would take to bump this particular limit by, say, a factor
of two – and I also don’t know whether a factor of two would be enough to
satisfy your expectations.

</code></pre><p>Great details there. It would also be good to know what the behavior is for the
Object, which has those 100% CPU stalls after ~8.3M, but not the same error
message...</p><p>Another fun note: if I modify the Object code to use only “integer IDs” the
code actually works fine, does not hit any errors, and is “blazingly fast” as
the kids call it</p><pre><code class="language-js">const myObject = {}

  myObject[i] = i
  if (i % 100000 == 0) {
    console.log(i)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>I presume that this code works because it detects that I’m using it like an
array and it decides to transform how it is working internally and not use a
hash-map-style data structure, so does not hit a limit. There is a slightly
higher limit though, e.g. 1 billion elements gives “Uncaught RangeError:
Invalid array length”</p><pre><code class="language-js">const myObject = {}
