cores (e.g. 2000% CPU usage) back to 0% CPU for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>We now know this was due to memory issues and garbage collection, but it was
confusing because it wasn't strictly showing up as GC usage in JVisualVm (the
GC usage, blue spikes on the left in fig 1, are small, but the orange spikes
are large, even though the memory issues are the problem)</p>
<p>Here is what it looked like during spiking (obviously, pushing the memory
limits here, a linked in article suggests having 6GB of "newgen" memory, so on
top of the old gen, tomcat needs a bunch more for the newgen to make things
happy.</p>
