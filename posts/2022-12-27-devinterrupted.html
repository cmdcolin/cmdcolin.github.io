<p>Many of these posts come from a blog called devinterrupted. They post things
related to "engineering management" type topics. And, they often "hit a chord"
and get highly upvoted and replied to. It's often the type of thing everyone can
add their two cents on, or offload some steam, or pontificate.</p>
<p>This wouldn't all be so bad, but it is sometimes posted with formulaic titles,
created by sock puppet accounts(?) and promoting a specific company (linearB). I
gathered as many posts from them as I can, helpfully grouped into clickbait-y

<p>The devinterrupted blog/podcast appears to be related to the linearB company,
who advocate a notion of "cycle time" (<a href="https://linearb.io/blog/cycle-time/">https://linearb.io/blog/cycle-time/</a>) as a
developer metric engineering managers should look at, and they pontificate and
interview interesting people. It's not all bad. But, it's pretty much a ploy to
get your clicks. They promote the "gitStream" product that linearB makes on all
the posts on devinterrupted. <a href="https://linearb.io/dev/gitstream/">https://linearb.io/dev/gitstream/</a></p>
<p>I'd recommend linearB stop posting these things and pretending that they are not
pushing it. How? I dunno. Youtubers everywhere are sponsored now. Ads are
everywhere. People deal with it. But be clear about it, and stop sock
puppetting.</p></div><div style="margin-top:200px"></div></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Blog archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/">Github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdcolin">Twitter</a> <a href="/projects">Projects</a><a href="/photos">Photos</a> <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a><a href="/about">About</a></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"The devinterrupted'ening of /r/programming","date":"2022-12-27","slug":"2022-12-27-devinterrupted","html":"\u003cp\u003eThere are hundreds of things in the world that are important, and complaining\nabout spammers is probably not that high on the list.
