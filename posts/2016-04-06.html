<li>dd deletes line in vim</li>
<li>Ctrl+d scrolls down in vim</li>
<li>Learn to love your package manager. Homebrew, NPM, gem, cpanm,
gvm/sdkman, etc. these all do amazing things</li>
<li>Once you learn bash, try zsh and oh-my-zsh, they have things like
case-insensitive tab completion</li>
<li>Don't make scripts that hardcode paths, make reusable command line
scripts. Use bash as your "REPL", not R.</li>
<li>git log -p helps analyze your log files in full details (make sure
autocoloring is turned on in your terminal)</li>
<li>There are keys to jump forward and backwards on the command line
text editor, learn them...don't scroll one char at a time</li>
<li>Learn how "PATH" works. Generally it is just a set of directories
connected by ":" separators. You can add things to the path by
saying "export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory/to/add" and you can add
this to ~/.bashrc for example</li>
<li>When your install process for a command line tool seems like
nonsense, try homebrew instead. barring that, learn PATH, and how to
run "make install", etc. Most of your headbashing from installing
programs is 90% can be explained by not understanding how the
developer is intending it to be used, 10% of the tool's install
process being wrong</li>
<li>Get a static analyzer and basic tests going on your codebase and run
it on travis-ci. Getting started with travis-ci is kind of a
learning curve, but it is worth it</li>
<li>Use cpanm instead of cpan for package management</li>
<li>Vocabulary learning curve: catalina is the same thing as tomcat.
CATALINA_HOME is the same thing as the tomcat folder</li>
<li>alias ll="ls -l", because I type "ll" hundreds of times a day.</li>
<li>For irc productivity, run irssi on a server in a "screen"
e.g. "screen irssi" and then you can come back to conversations
later by just logging into the server with ssh</li>
<li>Edit ~/.ssh/config to include your hostnames so you don't have to type out
long ssh
commands http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/</li>
<li>Use spaces instead of tabs in your source code (>:( yes I think
this is the one true way)</li>
<li>Try out nodejs and browserify in your spare time to make a "npm"
based app in the browser. it's fun.</li>
<li>Similarly, try making a simple "api" endpoint on the server side
with express.js or similar. can get started very quickly.</li>
<li>Learn how to get a mindset of writing tests. You can write tests
proactively (i.e. Test driven development), but you can also write
them "reactively" too (i.e. if have a bug that you fix, you can make
a test to make sure this doesn't happen anymore)</li>
<li>Similar to above, tests in this sense are more "sanity checks" than
they are formal proofs. Take "assert" logic and "debugging" code out
of main codebase and put them in tests</li>
<li>Minimize comments in your code, and also don't comment out code and
leave it present. Find a way to delete it and move on!</li>
<li>When you have a bunch of .orig files after doing a git merge, just
use git clean -f to get rid of them. Similarly, to get rid of
everythng, including things in your gitignore file (i.e. a super
clean) use git clean -fdx. It has a --exclude argument too</li>
