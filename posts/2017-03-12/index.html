several CSV files with some expectation that these files could basically be just
loaded into a database and jumped into production really quickly. If you are
using R and Shiny to make a data visualization dashboard, especially if it is
read only, this can actually be a reality for you: load those CSVs and just
pretend you’re a full featured database. I had to actually create some read
write functionality though. This was sort of experimental for me and I’m not
that well versed in databases, but I wanted to share my experience</p>
<p>When I started, I chose grails/groovy/hibernate/GORM as a platform to use. This
quickly turned into pain when I tried to make a data importer using grails also.</p>
<p>Each CSV row from the source file would have to be turned into many different
rows in the database because it represented multiple relationships, example:</p>
<p><img src="/media/158300473458_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Initially I made my data importer in grails, and was hardcoding column names
knowing full well this was really inflexible. At the same time I was also trying
to “iterate” on my database schema, and I’d want to re-import my data to test it
out, but it was really really slow. I tried many different approaches to try to
speed this up such as cleanUpGorm, StatelessSessions, and other tricks, but it
would take 10-20 minutes for imports on a 100KB input file.</p>
<p>What I basically realised is that for bulk data import</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using the ORM is really painful for bulk import.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can pre-process your data so that it is already in the format the
database expects, then you can use the CSV COPY command which is very fast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can then abandon the ORM mentality and even ignore it as a convenience
factor, then you can embrace my database system itself</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, after all this work, it just seemed like ORM treats the database as a
danger and something to be heavily abstracted over, but I actually found joy in
learning how to treat my database as a first class citizen. Soon I started
gaining appreciation of</p>
<ul>
<li>using plain SQL queries</li>
<li>learning about full text search in postgres with ts_query</li>
<li>learning about triggers to make a “last updated” field get updated
automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I am pretty happy this way, and although I miss some things like criteria
queries which are very powerful, I am happy that I can interact with my database
as a friend</p>
<p>At the very least, due to the fact that I now pre-process the data before
database loading, I can now import large amounts of data super fast with the CSV
COPY command</p> </div> <div id="giscus"></div> <script>
