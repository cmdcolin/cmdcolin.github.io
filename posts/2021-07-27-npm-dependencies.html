For example if you have ^6.0.0 in your package.json, you yarn upgrade it so in
the lockfile it says 6.1.0 but then later install another library that requires
a hard 6.0.1, yarn will decide to downgrade you to 6.0.1 (it will not have a
duplicate entry in yarn.lock, just that the 6.1.0 in the yarn.lock will
downgrade to 6.0.1)</p></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:20px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Blog archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin">Github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdcolin">Twitter</a> <a href="/projects">Projects</a> <a href="/photos">Photos</a> <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Do you understand your NPM dependencies?","date":"2021-07-27","slug":"2021-07-27-npm-dependencies","mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"var y=Object.defineProperty,m=Object.defineProperties;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var r=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,l=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var u=(e,a,o)=\u003ea in e?y(e,a,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:o}):e[a]=o,t=(e,a)=\u003e{for(var o in a||(a={}))r.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026u(e,o,a[o]);if(n)for(var o of n(a))l.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026u(e,o,a[o]);return e},s=(e,a)=\u003em(e,d(a));var p=(e,a)=\u003e{var o={};for(var i in e)r.call(e,i)\u0026\u0026a.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(o[i]=e[i]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026n)for(var i of n(e))a.indexOf(i)\u003c0\u0026\u0026l.call(e,i)\u0026\u0026(o[i]=e[i]);return o};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(o){var i=o,{components:e}=i,a=p(i,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,s(t(t({},layoutProps),a),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,`You are writing a library...or you are writing an app and you want to publish\nsome of the components of it as a library...`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Here are some questions in the form of comments\"),mdx(\"ul\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},`Did you realize that your yarn.lock will be ignored for anyone who installs\nyour libraries?`)),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},`Did you realize this means that your perfectly running test suite with your\nyarn.lock could be a failing case for consumers of your app unless you don\\u2019t\nuse semver strings like ^1.0.0 and just hardcode it to 1.0.0?`)),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},`Did you realize the default of ^1.0.0 automatically gets minor version bumps\nwhich are often fairly substantial changes, e.g. even breaking possibly?`)),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},`Did you know that larger libraries like @material-ui/core don\\u2019t like to bump\ntheir major version all the time for example so large changes are often made\nto the minor version?`)),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"Did you know if you run \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"yarn upgrade\"),`, it may update what is in your\nyarn.lock file but will not update what is in your package.json?`)),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},`Did you realize that this means that if you depend on the results of running\n`,mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"yarn upgrade\"),` e.g. it gave you a bugfix, you will be shipping buggy code to\nconsumers of your library?`))),mdx(\"p\",null,`Just something to be aware of!
