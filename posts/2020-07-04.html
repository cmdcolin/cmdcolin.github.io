<p>I am maybe what you'd call a front-end engineer. I have done web development for
about 7 years now. I worked on a variety of front end and back end projects,
including with Ruby on Rails, PHP, Perl CGI, Java servlets, and jquery/dojo
client side JS. I am pretty steeped in the "jquery spaghetti" / mutable DOM
everywhere era of things in my work on the frontend.</p>
<h2 id="my-new-job"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#my-new-job"><a href="#my-new-job" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>My new job!</h2>
<p>When I got a call about a new job in 2018, I was really happy and started in
June 2018. They decided they are going to do "the big rewrite" and are going to
use React. I start out as a remote worker. I fly into Berkeley for a single day
to sign HR paperwork!</p>
<p>Soon, my coworker starts building the new React app prototype. He keeps asking
me what state management library should we use, but I had no idea about React
still, much less what state management even is, and basically just was like "I
dunno!". I had no way to form an opinion.</p>
<p>I was also working on some stuff unrelated to the rewrite as the rest of the
team started prototyping in React, and I remained pretty out of the loop. We
would have weekly meetings but I just wouldn't really understand the goings-on.
I saw PropTypes, and mobx-state-tree model types, and class-based React
components, but nothing sunk in.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I had actually tried out React in 2016 and was very confused at that
time too, I had a bad taste in my mouth about React entirely! See Footnote 1.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-flounderingnot-understanding-whats-going-on-with-the-rewrite"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#i-am-flounderingnot-understanding-whats-going-on-with-the-rewrite"><a href="#i-am-flounderingnot-understanding-whats-going-on-with-the-rewrite" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>I am floundering...not understanding what's going on with the rewrite</h2>
<p>It's December 2018, I go home for Christmas and I have an honest talk with my
parents and tell them "I don't get what is happening in the new codebase, I'm
honestly unhappy, and it just does all this 'React' stuff" but I can't explain
React to them I just say the code is automatically reacting to other things.</p>
<p>My parents say "well if you are unhappy, you might have to leave your job!".
They were not cheering for me to leave, but they understood that this wasn't
really sustainable. At this point, it really hit me that I do like this job and
I decided to try to focus on work.</p>
<h2 id="i-try-and-make-an-honest-attempt-to-get-involved-in-the-project"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#i-try-and-make-an-honest-attempt-to-get-involved-in-the-project"><a href="#i-try-and-make-an-honest-attempt-to-get-involved-in-the-project" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>I try and make an honest attempt to get involved in the project</h2>
<p>On January 10th 2019, I make my first commit to the rewrite by doing some
monkey-see monkey-do type coding. I copy a bunch of files and just put them in
the right place, tweak some lines, and start to figure out how to make things
run. By the end of January 2019 I get my first code change merged.</p>
<p>I also suggested that we start doing <strong>pair-programming sessions</strong>. Once I
started doing this, meeting weekly with my coworkers, it made a huge difference
for me in learning how to code. The things we discussed in these sessions often
still went way over my head due to how my coworkers presented stuff or how much
they assumed I understood. Nevertheless, these were extremely helpful for me to
help get caught up.</p>
<h2 id="reading-learning-react"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#reading-learning-react"><a href="#reading-learning-react" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Reading "Learning React"</h2>
<p>In March 2019, I got the book "Learning React" (O'Reilly2017
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react/9781491954614/">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react/9781491954614/</a>) for my
kindle. Reading this book was a big help I felt, and provided a needed "brain
reset" for me. The book worked well for me, I read it each night on my kindle.
The book was good at showing how things like ES6 syntax like destructuring,
arrow functions, etc help fit into the React ecosystem (I was still steeped in
ES5). Also, with the book, I could focus, not have distractions, etc. My eyes
would just glaze over every time I clicked on internet tutorials. I did not try
to live code any of the examples of "Learning React", I just read it as is
before bed.</p>
<h2 id="applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process"><a href="#applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Applying lessons to work is still a slow going process</h2>
<p>So anyways, work goes on, and I'm learning, but our codebase still feels pretty
complicated and alien. React is one thing, but mobx is another. I tried
downloading the mobx-state-tree book but it goes over my head
(<a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781789344837/8/ch08lvl1sec47/an-opinionated-mobx-with-mobx-state-tree">https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781789344837/8/ch08lvl1sec47/an-opinionated-mobx-with-mobx-state-tree</a>)
and the way mobx is glued to React via mobx-react doesn't really click. I
remember asking my coworkers why my component was not updating and they
eventually find out it's because I keep not using the observer() wrapper around
my components, which is obvious when you understand the system but it stumped me
as a learner.</p>
<h2 id="trying-out-typescript"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#trying-out-typescript"><a href="#trying-out-typescript" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Trying out Typescript</h2>
<p>In April 2019, I start to experiment with Typescript and release a Typescript
version of some data parsing code. I start by explicitly specifying a lot of
types but I eventually start getting into the zen of "type inference".</p>
<h2 id="using-react-hooks"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#using-react-hooks"><a href="#using-react-hooks" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Using React hooks</h2>
<p>In May 2019, I try out my first React hook, a useState. It worked well. I
couldn't really figure out why I would use it instead of using mobx for state
management we used elsewhere, but the example was that it was a click-and-drag
and it made sense to keep that click-and-drag mouse position state local to the
component rather than the "app".</p>
<p>The book "Learning React" also helped me to understand hooks but only
indirectly. The book had examples of pure function components, but was written
pre-hooks. With hooks added in React 16.8, it took a little brain exercising,
but I understood how hooks can be applied to function components.</p>
<h2 id="using-react-testing-library"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#using-react-testing-library"><a href="#using-react-testing-library" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Using <code>react-testing-library</code></h2>
<p>In June 2019, I was tasked with creating "integration test" level tests for our
app. We had none before this. I had used <code>react-testing-library</code> for some
components before this, but the integration level test I used
<code>react-testing-library</code> to render the entire "app level" component. I was happy
to pioneer this and try this out, and I think this has worked out well.</p>
<p>Some caveats: I got very caught up with trying to do canvas tests initially. I
really wanted to use <code>jest-mock-canvas</code> but we were using <code>OffscreenCanvas</code> via
a pretty complicated string of things, so I don't make progress here, and I also
got confused about the relationship between <code>node-canvas</code> and <code>jest-mock-canvas</code>
(they are basically totally different approaches). Later on, I find using
<code>jest-image-snapshot</code> of the canvas contents works nice (ref
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33269093/how-to-add-canvas-support-to-my-tests-in-jest">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33269093/how-to-add-canvas-support-to-my-tests-in-jest</a>)</p>
<p>Other random note: when building out the integration tests, we got a lot of "act
warnings" which were confusing. These were fixed in React 16.9 (released August
2019), but we had to ignore them while we developed on 16.8 and the warnings
basically just confused me a lot and made it feel like I was battling a very
complex system rather than a nice simple one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#conclusions"><a href="#conclusions" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Overall, I just wanted to write up my whole experience. It felt really difficult
for me to make these changes. I also went through a breakup during this time,
had a bad living situation, etc. so things were a struggle. If anyone else has
had struggles learning React, tell your story, and let me know. I'd like to also
thank everyone who helped me along the way. I feel like a much better coder now,
yet, I should always keep growing. The feeling of uncomfortableness could be a
growing experience.</p>
<h2 id="footnote-1"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-1" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Footnote 1</h2>
<p>I also had tried using React in 2016... but it was unsuccessful, but maybe for
interesting reasons?</p>
<p>I was tasked with making a normal form with text input elements, and I wanted to
code and wanted to try using React. I tried importing React via a CDN and gave
it a shot, and it seemed simple enough, but I kept getting really confused about
how to even read and initialize the value of a textbox for example properly.
TLDR: I was not aware of what a <em>controlled component</em> was.</p>
<p>The idea of controlled components (not a word in my vocabulary at the time) was
quite unintuitive and instead, I kept googling weird things like "two way data
binding react" and variants of this. I had never used Angular but I heard of
two-way data binding from Angular, and I just felt like it was what I needed. I
even posted about my frustrations about this on the React subreddit and was
downvoted. Felt bad. I was just really confused. I abandoned the project in
React and just used our normal jqueryish thing.</p>
<h2 id="footnote-2"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-2" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Footnote 2</h2>
<p>Why did I have such a poor grasp on React? I can't exactly say. I feel like I
was a competent developer, but I had some severe mental barriers to
understanding the way React worked. I wish someone would have just told me
something like "React is basically like functions that can return HTML". EDIT: I
wrote

try to explain some of the basics that I feel like could have been helpful for
me</p>
<h2 id="footnote-3"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#footnote-3"><a href="#footnote-3" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>Footnote 3</h2>
<p>I am not sure if I would recommend Learning React to all learners. I think it
helped me, but there may be other options that work better for you. Look around
and find what what looks right. EDIT: the new beta.reactjs.org might be useful,
but again, the book is what really helped me as it was less ADHD-inducing than
the web</p></div><div style="margin-top:200px"></div></article><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Blog archive</a> <a

At this point, it really hit me that I do like this job and\nI decided to try to focus on work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-try-and-make-an-honest-attempt-to-get-involved-in-the-project\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#i-try-and-make-an-honest-attempt-to-get-involved-in-the-project\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#i-try-and-make-an-honest-attempt-to-get-involved-in-the-project\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI try and make an honest attempt to get involved in the project\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn January 10th 2019, I make my first commit to the rewrite by doing some\nmonkey-see monkey-do type coding. I copy a bunch of files and just put them in\nthe right place, tweak some lines, and start to figure out how to make things\nrun. By the end of January 2019 I get my first code change merged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also suggested that we start doing \u003cstrong\u003epair-programming sessions\u003c/strong\u003e. Once I\nstarted doing this, meeting weekly with my coworkers, it made a huge difference\nfor me in learning how to code. The things we discussed in these sessions often\nstill went way over my head due to how my coworkers presented stuff or how much\nthey assumed I understood. Nevertheless, these were extremely helpful for me to\nhelp get caught up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reading-learning-react\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#reading-learning-react\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#reading-learning-react\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eReading \"Learning React\"\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn March 2019, I got the book \"Learning React\" (O'Reilly2017\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react/9781491954614/\"\u003ehttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react/9781491954614/\u003c/a\u003e) for my\nkindle. Reading this book was a big help I felt, and provided a needed \"brain\nreset\" for me. The book worked well for me, I read it each night on my kindle.\nThe book was good at showing how things like ES6 syntax like destructuring,\narrow functions, etc help fit into the React ecosystem (I was still steeped in\nES5). Also, with the book, I could focus, not have distractions, etc. My eyes\nwould just glaze over every time I clicked on internet tutorials. I did not try\nto live code any of the examples of \"Learning React\", I just read it as is\nbefore bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eApplying lessons to work is still a slow going process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo anyways, work goes on, and I'm learning, but our codebase still feels pretty\ncomplicated and alien. React is one thing, but mobx is another. I tried\ndownloading the mobx-state-tree book but it goes over my head\n(\u003ca href=\"https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781789344837/8/ch08lvl1sec47/an-opinionated-mobx-with-mobx-state-tree\"\u003ehttps://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781789344837/8/ch08lvl1sec47/an-opinionated-mobx-with-mobx-state-tree\u003c/a\u003e)\nand the way mobx is glued to React via mobx-react doesn't really click. I\nremember asking my coworkers why my component was not updating and they\neventually find out it's because I keep not using the observer() wrapper around\nmy components, which is obvious when you understand the system but it stumped me\nas a learner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"trying-out-typescript\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#trying-out-typescript\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#trying-out-typescript\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTrying out Typescript\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn April 2019, I start to experiment with Typescript and release a Typescript\nversion of some data parsing code. I start by explicitly specifying a lot of\ntypes but I eventually start getting into the zen of \"type inference\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"using-react-hooks\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#using-react-hooks\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#using-react-hooks\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eUsing React hooks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn May 2019, I try out my first React hook, a useState. It worked well. I\ncouldn't really figure out why I would use it instead of using mobx for state\nmanagement we used elsewhere, but the example was that it was a click-and-drag\nand it made sense to keep that click-and-drag mouse position state local to the\ncomponent rather than the \"app\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book \"Learning React\" also helped me to understand hooks but only\nindirectly. The book had examples of pure function components, but was written\npre-hooks. With hooks added in React 16.8, it took a little brain exercising,\nbut I understood how hooks can be applied to function components.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"using-react-testing-library\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#using-react-testing-library\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#using-react-testing-library\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eUsing \u003ccode\u003ereact-testing-library\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2019, I was tasked with creating \"integration test\" level tests for our\napp. We had none before this. I had used \u003ccode\u003ereact-testing-library\u003c/code\u003e for some\ncomponents before this, but the integration level test I used\n\u003ccode\u003ereact-testing-library\u003c/code\u003e to render the entire \"app level\" component. I was happy\nto pioneer this and try this out, and I think this has worked out well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome caveats: I got very caught up with trying to do canvas tests initially. I\nreally wanted to use \u003ccode\u003ejest-mock-canvas\u003c/code\u003e but we were using \u003ccode\u003eOffscreenCanvas\u003c/code\u003e via\na pretty complicated string of things, so I don't make progress here, and I also\ngot confused about the relationship between \u003ccode\u003enode-canvas\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ejest-mock-canvas\u003c/code\u003e\n(they are basically totally different approaches). Later on, I find using\n\u003ccode\u003ejest-image-snapshot\u003c/code\u003e of the canvas contents works nice (ref\n\u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33269093/how-to-add-canvas-support-to-my-tests-in-jest\"\u003ehttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/33269093/how-to-add-canvas-support-to-my-tests-in-jest\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther random note: when building out the integration tests, we got a lot of \"act\nwarnings\" which were confusing. These were fixed in React 16.9 (released August\n2019), but we had to ignore them while we developed on 16.8 and the warnings\nbasically just confused me a lot and made it feel like I was battling a very\ncomplex system rather than a nice simple one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusions\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#conclusions\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#conclusions\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eConclusions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I just wanted to write up my whole experience. It felt really difficult\nfor me to make these changes. I also went through a breakup during this time,\nhad a bad living situation, etc. so things were a struggle. If anyone else has\nhad struggles learning React, tell your story, and let me know. I'd like to also\nthank everyone who helped me along the way. I feel like a much better coder now,\nyet, I should always keep growing. The feeling of uncomfortableness could be a\ngrowing experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"footnote-1\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFootnote 1\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also had tried using React in 2016... but it was unsuccessful, but maybe for\ninteresting reasons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tasked with making a normal form with text input elements, and I wanted to\ncode and wanted to try using React. I tried importing React via a CDN and gave\nit a shot, and it seemed simple enough, but I kept getting really confused about\nhow to even read and initialize the value of a textbox for example properly.\nTLDR: I was not aware of what a \u003cem\u003econtrolled component\u003c/em\u003e was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of controlled components (not a word in my vocabulary at the time) was\nquite unintuitive and instead, I kept googling weird things like \"two way data\nbinding react\" and variants of this. I had never used Angular but I heard of\ntwo-way data binding from Angular, and I just felt like it was what I needed. I\neven posted about my frustrations about this on the React subreddit and was\ndownvoted. Felt bad. I was just really confused. I abandoned the project in\nReact and just used our normal jqueryish thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"footnote-2\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-2\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#footnote-2\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFootnote 2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I have such a poor grasp on React? I can't exactly say. I feel like I\nwas a competent developer, but I had some severe mental barriers to\nunderstanding the way React worked. I wish someone would have just told me\nsomething like \"React is basically like functions that can return HTML\".
