I did the rustlings exercises but I
knew the concepts would fade rapidly from my brain without some practice. I have
now started making a music player using Rust+GTK4.</p>
<p>I chose GTK4 to have a linux native GUI music player. Particularly, I have a
particular <code>foobar2000</code> setup that I wanted to emulate. I have used <code>foobar2000</code>
under wine (windows emulator on linux) and it’s not terrible, but it has
background CPU consumption of about 15% idle and doesn’t feel quite right
sometimes. I have used a variety of other linux music players such as
<code>quodlibet</code> (GUI/GTK based) and <code>cmus</code> (command line) but they didn’t really
feel quite right.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-a-tech-stack">Choosing a tech stack</h3>
<p>I started by attempting with <code>Relm4</code>, which I may return to at some point, but
trying to juggle learning Relm4-style widgets, GTK, and rust all at once was a
bit much. I stepped to using <code>gtk4-rs</code> directly.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-spreadsheet-style-data-grid-of-tracks-with-columnview">Create a “spreadsheet style” data grid of tracks with <code>ColumnView</code></h3>
<p>Then, I wanted to create a data grid showing to display e.g. a table with
artist, track, album, etc. I chose to use the GTK
<a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ColumnView.html"><code>ColumnView</code></a> to drive this. I
stumbled around looking for example code, but there was none specifically for
the <code>ColumnView</code>. I also realized the <code>ListView</code> example from the <code>gtk4-rs</code>
examples with it’s factory function had similar needs that the <code>ColumnView</code>.</p>
<p>I found out that I basically needed to create a <code>ListStore</code>. I thought if I
could make my own <code>GObject</code> subclass, it would solve everything, but I had
trouble getting making this work (rust doesn’t have the concept of extending a
class for one thing, you implement various traits instead). Finally, I randomly
stumbled on this link using a <code>BoxedAnyObject</code> with a good example of storing
data in a ListStore
<a href="https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html">https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html</a></p>
<p>The <code>BoxedAnyObject</code> is a <code>GObject</code>, so this was an good route to storing the
<code>ListView</code> items. There was no example code for connecting the <code>ListStore</code> with
the <code>ColumnView</code>, so I struggled for awhile before realizing that the <code>ListView</code>
example in the <code>gtk4-rs</code> codebase has similar concepts.</p>
<p>See [1] for minimal usage of <code>ColumnView</code> that I contributed to the <code>gtk4-rs</code>
repo!</p>
<h3 id="choosing-an-audio-library">Choosing an audio library</h3>
<p>To actually play audio, I looked at a couple options. There was even one option
called GTK
<a href="https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gtk4/struct.MediaFile.html"><code>MediaFile</code></a>
which should to be able to play e.g. mp3s, making my job of making a media
player much simpler, but it produced an error
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;oq=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57.267j0j7&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8">“GTK could not find a media module. Check your installation.”</a>
which had very few references on the internet. I figured this could be difficult
to solve or point to issues I could face later on making minimal executables for
users.</p>
<p>So, next I tried out <code>symphonia</code> (<a href="https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/">https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/</a>).
Symphonia requires a lot more code to work (~1000 lines so far, copying from the
<code>symphonia-play</code> example) but it has broad file format support, pure-rust audio
stack, etc. I got confused about how to package it into an easy-to-use system
though, having to create a symphonia player on a separate thread, so I looked
elsewhere…</p>
<p>Next I turned to <code>rodio</code>. This works well, and automatically plays on a separate
thread, but I found two issues 1) I have to initialize the rodio player in “fn
main” and not anywhere else, or it would just play a short blip of audio
(<a href="https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/381">https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/381</a>). Then, it turned out that the
<code>rodio</code>
<a href="https://docs.rs/rodio/0.14.0/rodio/struct.Sink.html#method.stop"><code>Sink</code></a>
instance (which you pass audio to) cannot stop and then play new song xref
(<a href="https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/315">https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/315</a>). To workaround, I replace it
with a new <code>Sink</code>.</p>
<p>This required me to learn about <code>RefCell</code>. I googled probably about 50 things
just grasping at straws for awhile, but then landed on the solution of putting
the <code>Sink</code> in a <code>Rc&#x3C;RefCell&#x3C;Sink>></code>, then that allows me to pass it into my
callback that handles double clicking the songs in the <code>ColumnView</code>, and then I
borrow the <code>RefCell</code> mutably to replace it with a new <code>Sink</code>.</p>
<h3 id="reading-audio-metadata-into-an-sqlite-db">Reading audio metadata into an <code>sqlite</code> DB</h3>
<p>I also wanted to have the option of reading and writing audio metadata.
Symphonia only reads metadata, so I found the <code>lofty</code> crate.</p>
<p>I also realized that reading tens of thousands of file’s metadata at each app
startup would be slow, so I endeavored to store that data in an <code>sqlite</code>
database. I found that music players like <code>foobar2000</code> and <code>0xdeadbeef</code> have
databases of track metadata also (Example folder on <code>foobar2000</code> (1.x) for this
snap/foobar2000/433/foobar2000/profile/library/74E45640B1C695CC/meta-0001,
meta-0002, etc.)</p>
<p>I used the <code>walkdir</code> crate to walk a directory for files, <code>lofty</code> to read the
metadata, and then finally inserted the data into the <code>sqlite</code> db. I am still
working out the schema for the database but it provisionally associates data
with a primary key of filename.</p>
<h3 id="learning-about-reference-counting-and-move-semantics">Learning about reference counting and move semantics</h3>
<p>Originally I queried the sqlite database and stored a <code>Vec&#x3C;Track></code>, where
<code>Track</code> is a struct with artist, album, song title, etc. I realized that this
causes issues passing this around to different functions, and storing them in
the <code>BoxedAnyObject</code>, (example thread discussing issue
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42954008/how-to-pass-one-vec-to-multiple-functions-in-rust">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42954008/how-to-pass-one-vec-to-multiple-functions-in-rust</a>)
so I changed functions to accept slices of the Vec, and to make it a
<code>Vec&#x3C;Rc&#x3C;Track>></code> instead of just <code>Vec&#x3C;Track></code> (another related thread
<a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/self-has-an-anonymous-lifetime-but-it-needs-to-satisfy-a-static-lifetime-requirement/58641/3">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/self-has-an-anonymous-lifetime-but-it-needs-to-satisfy-a-static-lifetime-requirement/58641/3</a>).</p>

<h3 id="footnote-1-creating-a-pr-to-the-gtk4-rs-repo-to-demonstrate-example-columnview-usage">Footnote 1: Creating a PR to the <code>gtk4-rs</code> repo to demonstrate example ColumnView usage</h3>
<p>I created a PR (<a href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/pull/1111">https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/pull/1111</a>) to demonstrate
simple <code>ColumnView</code> usage. The code review that was given on the PR was
excellent. They explained how to simplify the code I submitted so that each grid
cell was very minimal (starting from a <code>gtk::Box</code> with a <code>gtk::Label</code> inside of
it, to just being a <code>gtk::Inscription</code> which is very fast). Big thanks to the
team for helping out with this!</p>
<p>After this hurdle was crossed, I felt much more comfortable in the GTK mindset,
and I quickly fleshed out some more UI for the app</p> </div> <div id="giscus"></div> <script>
