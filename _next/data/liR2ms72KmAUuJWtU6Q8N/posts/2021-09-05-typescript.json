CPU usage</p>\n<p>This is because the default configuration polls for file changes (constantly\nasks the computer if there are changes every 250ms or so). There is an\nalternative configuration for this to change it to a file watcher so it\nreceives file system notifications on file change. There is discussion here on\nthis.</p>\n<p>The main summary is that a env variable set to\nTSC_WATCHFILE=UseFsEventsWithFallbackDynamicPolling allows this</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31048\">https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31048</a></p>\n<p>The issue thread shows that it can go from roughly ~7% idle CPU usage to 0.2%.\nThis corresponds with what I see too after applying this! Detailed docs for\ntypescript discuss some of the reasoning being not making this the default</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Configuring%20Watch.md#background\">https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Configuring%20Watch.md#background</a></p>\n<p>It claims that some OS specific behaviors of file watching could be harmful to\nmaking it the default. For example, that (maybe?) on linux, it may use a large\nnumber of file watchers which can exceed notify handles (this is a setting I\ncommonly have to increase in linux, guide here\n<a href=\"https://dev.to/rubiin/ubuntu-increase-inotify-watcher-file-watch-limit-kf4\">https://dev.to/rubiin/ubuntu-increase-inotify-watcher-file-watch-limit-kf4</a>)</p>\n<p>PS: if you have a package.json of a <code>create-react-app --template typescript</code> or\nsomething like this then you can edit the package.json to apply this\nautomatically</p>\n<pre><code>-\"start\": \"react-scripts start\"\n+\"start\": \"cross-env TSC_WATCHFILE=UseFsEventsWithFallbackDynamicPolling react-scripts start\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Phew. I can already feel my laptop running cooler...or at least I can sleep\nmore soundly knowing that my readers adopt this and save some CPU cycles for\nplanet earth...and hopefully don't run into any of the caveats</p>\n<p>Edit: It may be worth it to note, the 'UseFsEvents' part of this uses the\nnode.js fs.watch API and the polling based API is based on fs.watchFile</p>\n<p>Fun table of how the watchers are implemented on different OSs\n[<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31048#issuecomment-495483957\">1</a>]</p>\n<pre><code>On Linux systems, this uses inotify(7).\nOn BSD systems, this uses kqueue(2).\nOn macOS, this uses kqueue(2) for files and FSEvents for directories.\nOn SunOS systems (including Solaris and SmartOS), this uses event ports.\nOn Windows systems, this feature depends on ReadDirectoryChangesW.\nOn Aix systems, this feature depends on AHAFS, which must be enabled.\n</code></pre>\n<p>And in general, these should all respond more or less the same, but there are\nsmall corner cases that are discussed\n<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_availability\">https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_availability</a></p>\n<p>Disclaimer: it may be worth reading the reasons that typescript does not have\nthis enabled by default before pushing this into your dev environment and all\nyour teammates, but as far as I could tell, it seems ok!</p>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
