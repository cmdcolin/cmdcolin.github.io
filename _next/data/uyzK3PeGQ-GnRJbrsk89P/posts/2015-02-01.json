I thought I'd try to\nvisualize the data using R and ggplot2 as an exercise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/5rVnQHC.png\"></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/109823235838_0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1. The fancy ggplot2 graph of salaries with standard deviation bars\ncomparing salaries of BS/MS grads (red) with BS grads (blue).</p>\n<p>As a CS grad, I suppose I'm happy to see that we have the a highest average\nsalary right out of the gate. CS also has a high standard deviation which I\nthought was interesting. Perhaps CS majors work in a myriad of fields that\ndemand computational skills where other engineering majors may be more focused\non certain types of fields, giving less deviation.</p>\n<p>In the process of making this graph, I was looking for how to do the\nside-by-side bar charts in ggplot and ended up supplying a \"correction\" to a\nanswer on crossvalidated, a stackexchange site. The correction entailed how the\nsyntax for using reshape2 vs reshape has changed slightly, so hopefully that\nhelps other people searching for the same issue.</p>\n<p>Here is the code for processing</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-R\"> library(xlsx)\n library(ggplot2)\n library(reshape2)\n\n salaries=read.xlsx(\"workbook.xlsx\",1)\n df=melt(salaries,measure.vars = c(\"BS.MS.annual.salary\",\n \"BS.annual.salary\"))\n #awkward step to merge standard deviations\n df[df$variable==\"BS.MS.annual.salary\",\"stdev\"]=df[df$variable==\"BS.MS.annual.salary\",\"stdev.1\"]\n ggplot(df, aes(NA., value, fill=variable)) +\n      geom_bar(position=\"dodge\",stat=\"identity\") +\n      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=value-stdev, ymax=value+stdev),\n position=position_dodge(width=0.9)) +\n      ggtitle(\"Salary for 2013 class of Engineering (2014 survey)\") +\n      xlab(\"Major\") +\n      ylab(\"Salary w/ stddev\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>Table pictured</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/109823235838_1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
