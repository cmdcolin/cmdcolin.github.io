The fancy ggplot2 graph of salaries with standard deviation\nbars comparing salaries of BS/MS grads (red) with BS grads (blue).</p>\n<p>As a CS grad, I suppose I'm happy to see that we have the a highest\naverage salary right out of the gate. CS also has a high standard\ndeviation which I thought was interesting. Perhaps CS majors work in a\nmyriad of fields that demand computational skills where other\nengineering majors may be more focused on certain types of fields,\ngiving less deviation.</p>\n<p>In the process of making this graph, I was looking for how to do the\nside-by-side bar charts in ggplot and ended up supplying a \"correction\"\nto a answer on crossvalidated, a stackexchange site.
