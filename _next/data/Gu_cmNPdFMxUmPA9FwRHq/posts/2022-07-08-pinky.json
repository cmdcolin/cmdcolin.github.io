This is a common one you hear recommended and\nit may help, and it has less contortion, particularly for chrome with one\nhand use. So you can say capslock+w, capslock+t, but it is still using pinky\nand can be stressful if not careful (capslock+w fine, capslock+t still\ncontortion if done with one hand)</li>\n<li>More use of the right-hand-only shortcuts or at least avoiding using the left\npinky for shortcuts. I don't have many of these but will look into retraining\nmyself for some of these. I am testing out right ctrl+] for leader in tmux,\nand - and = for split window horizontal and vertical</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is not great to get to this point. My hand posture and body posture at the\nkeyboard has been bad for years, and it has caught up to me. I recommend people\nbe aware of contorting their hand too much, and use good keyboard etiquette\nlest they suffer the same!</p>\n<h2 id=\"any-more-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#any-more-ideas\"><a href=\"#any-more-ideas\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Any more ideas?</h2>\n<p>Let me know of ways you take care of your hands (hardware, software, or\notherwise)</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#other-resources\"><a href=\"#other-resources\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Other resources</h2>\n<p>See this post by Matt Might for some more resources\n<a href=\"https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/\">https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"extenuating-circumstances\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#extenuating-circumstances\"><a href=\"#extenuating-circumstances\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Extenuating circumstances</h2>\n<p>I am not sure if it really affects my typing, but I was bitten by a dog several\nyears ago. The dog clamped down on both my hands one after the other and got my\nleft especially bad, which required stitches. One fairly deep puncture was on\nthe left side of my left hand, which could plausibly affect my pinky. Photo\nbelow</p>\n<p><img src=\"/photos/pinky.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
