Let's say you want to plot the\nvalue 1500, and put it into screen coordinates, so you take that and subtract\nthe minimum of the range</p>\n<pre><code>1500-1000\n</code></pre>\n<p>Second, you know your point is going to be halfway in the range, and in\ngeneral, to get this position, you divide now by the size of the interval you\nare plotting in, e.g. 2000-1000</p>\n<pre><code>(1500-1000)/(2000-1000) = 0.5\n</code></pre>\n<p>We get 0.5 as expected. Then you multiply this proportion times the width of\nbox you are rendering in, e.g. 100 pixels wide, and get that you put your pixel\nat position 50px</p>\n<p>To summarize, the general formula for plotting a point x in a range (x1,x2) on\na screen of width w is</p>\n<pre><code>w*(x -  x1) / (x2 - x1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course same thing applies for y</p>\n<pre><code>h*(y - y1) / (y2 - y1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This does not take into account small possible adjustments for closed vs open\nranges, which could be important to avoid subpixel rendering on a canvas, but\nthat can be a further exercise</p>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
