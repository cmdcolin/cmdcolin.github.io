{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Cheating in your computer science class by copying from stackoverflow","date":"2015-12-17","slug":"2015-12-17","content":"<p>I would like to tell a story about how I provided some personal tutoring\nhelp for a friend in a computer science class, and talk about a nagging\nfeeling that really felt wrong for me.</p>\n<p>So, a long time ago, in a land far far away, a friend took an\nintermediate class on C++. I was first updated on his progress when he\nemailed me to get some help with some compiler errors. I was happy to\nhelp the young padawan. Here was the error:</p>\n<pre><code>         test.cpp:42:43: error: non-ASCII characters are not allowed outside of literals\n                and identifiers\n              for (startScan = 0; startScan &#x3C; (size âˆ’ 1); startScan++)\n                                                    ^~\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, what does this say to you? For me, it was actually very clear what\nthe error meant. It simply meant that this code was taken from\nsomewhere, and copied and pasted into the compiler. I know that because\nif they had typed it themself, they definitely would not get this error,\nbecause it is the error that implies something was automatically\nconverted to a unicode dash, mostly something done during copying and\npasting. At this point, I just kind of laughed, and helped him fix that.\nI showed how the compiler is actually pretty smart and can help fix\nthese errors and then I said \"l8r dude\".</p>\n<p>The next week, I had another skype meeting with him, and this time I\nwanted to help a little more. It was pretty clear when we started that\nhe was using code that was copied and pasted again. I said, \"uh,\nok,....I'm not sure we need that now, but let's just keep going\", and\nthen I sat down and started helping. I wanted to help get all the\ndetails of the program working, so I helped guide the solution. Each\ntime we needed to test the program, it required repeating some input\nlines via <code>cin >></code>, which is really annoying (obviously, you should test\nyour code with unit tests, but universities don't teach that, a rant for\nanother day). Anyways, it took awhile, because coding really does just\ntake time, but in the end he finally got it fixed and I said great job,\nand he turned it in!</p>\n<p>Now, on my friends last assignment, I got another call for help, and\nwhen we started skype, I found yet again that he had copied code from\nsomewhere, which included a C++ class and a main function for doing\nbinary trees. I just simply said \"dude, delete that, we don't need it\"\nand so he deleted it, but I think maybe he had worked on this copied\ncode for awhile, and maybe felt it was kind of his, so was apprehensive.\nI insisted though. Then we walked through the assignment again, very\nslowly. I spent probably 2-3 hours helping him out that night. During\nthose hours, I saw him continually making many programming mistakes such\nas just not knowing how to declare variable or a function properly, or\njust not knowing what to do next. This was kind of frustrating!!! But I\nwanted to absolutely teach him how to make it right! I was patient\nthough, and I wanted to teach a fun lesson, so I showed how you can do\nsome \"unit tests\" which avoids having to constantly re-enter your data\nvia <code>cin >></code>....</p>\n<p>Now, the padawan completed his C++ class, and then we all were happy\never after....but a disturbance in the force was sensed...\n<img src=\"http://zelcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stackoverflow-logo-dumpster.jpg\" alt=\"image\">\nImage from <a href=\"http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/\">http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/</a></p>\n<p>I was reminded about all this due to seeing that <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-on-the-stack-excha\">StackOverflow is now\nchanging their \"license\" over all the little snippets of\ncode</a>\nthat are posted on their site. It just makes me reflect on literally HOW\nOFTEN PEOPLE JUST COPY AND PASTE FROM THERE. They might understand what\nthey are doing, or they seriously might not!!! I think it is a real\nproblem that people sometimes do not understand, but I cannot deny that\nit can be helpful too.</p>\n<p>If I reflect on education in general, I recall when I took a University\nlevel physics class... it was really hard! We had to enter our validated\nsolutions for the math problems into a computerized website homework\nportal, and that involved being 100% correct about things. Now, what if\nthere was just a physicsoverflow, where they not only had Q&#x26;A, but they\nhad \"programs\" that gave you all the right answers to your homework\nproblems that you could just copy and paste and use as solutions to your\nhomework? This isn't even in the realm of asking for \"homework help\"\nanymore, this is just pure cheating if you can copy your answers from\nsomewhere. It is disappointing though because this is what people are\ndoing in computer science!! These students are missing out on basic\nunderstanding of code. !!thisIsNotOk();</p>\n<p>Now, at least when I was being a tutor for my friend, I felt like my\nadvice helped my friend learn some things, not just give answers. But\nwhat if I was not there? I guess there is a certain \"impersonal quality\"\nthat makes asking Google/StackOverflow for answers less like\nconventional \"cheating\", but that is still wrong. I think it would be\ngood if more expert knowledge was available for all people, and not just\ncopy and paste snippets. As a start, I thought that <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192385-life-after-moocs/fulltext\">this post by Philip\nCompeau and Pavel\nPevzner</a>\n(who teach a Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC on Coursera) was very\ninteresting, and I really liked their quote:</p>\n<p>\"Online education should move toward replicating the experience of\nreceiving one-on-one tutoring.\"</p>\n<p>That sounds great, but how can this be acheived? And how can it be done\nright? I think it really requires the student to \"learn how to learn\"</p>\n<p>If I think back to a long time ago, I remember being in 4th or 5th grade\nand I did a book report on World War 1, and I went to the library. I\nremember desperately flipping through pages of a 100 page book to try to\nfind some snippets of information to support some basic idea that I\nwanted to talk about. Maybe I wanted to know something specific, but the\nproblem was that I wasn't REALLY READING THE BOOK! I probably could have\nhad a better understanding of the topic if I had just read it, or even a\npart of it, and asked for help, but instead I just picked and chose\nsnippets from the book to \"sound smart\". I am very guilty of this type\nof error in many instances throughout my school career, so I am no\nsaint! I even have a phrase to describe this style of learning...I call\nit \"predatory learning\" and it is probably the worst kind of learning\nstyle. Predatory learners often pick and choose from scraps of info, but\nthey never get a full meal!</p>\n<p>::: {#footer}\n[ December 17th, 2015 3:05am ]{#timestamp} [learning]{.tag}\n[education]{.tag} [computer science]{.tag} [stackoverflow]{.tag}\n[fail]{.tag}\n:::</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
