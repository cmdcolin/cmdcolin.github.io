This can cause issues sometimes called\n\"ulnar tunnel\" or \"cubital tunnel\" which is relatively distinct from \"carpal\ntunnel\" and is more strongly related to the ring and pinky fingers!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not applying too much pressure to elbows on armrests (ulnar nerve) while at\ndesk</li>\n<li>Avoid typing with elbows bent e.g. straighten arms (often related to using\nlaptop on lap, couch, etc)</li>\n<li>Avoid sleeping with elbows super bent e.g. I get this sleeping on my stomach\nwith my elbows under my body</li>\n<li>Use ulner/elbow brace for sleeping or daytime usage. I am ordering one of\nthese to try out</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"technical-approaches-and-key-remappings\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#technical-approaches-and-key-remappings\"><a href=\"#technical-approaches-and-key-remappings\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Technical approaches and key remappings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remap caps lock to left+ctrl. This is a common one you hear recommended and\nit may help, and it has less contortion, particularly for chrome with one\nhand use. So you can say capslock+w, capslock+t, but it is still using pinky\nand can be stressful if not careful (capslock+w fine, capslock+t still\ncontortion if done with one hand)</li>\n<li>More use of the right-hand-only shortcuts or at least avoiding using the left\npinky for shortcuts. I don't have many of these but will look into retraining\nmyself for some of these. I am testing out right ctrl+] for leader in tmux,\nand - and = for split window horizontal and vertical</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\"><a href=\"#things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Things still to try: better ergonomics and gadgets</h3>\n<p>In truth, I type a lot on a laptop with a poor keyboard layout, and often use\nit away from a desk. I think improving my desk ergonomics could help, and\ngetting a fancy keyboard and maybe mouse (though I much prefer a touchpad)\ncould be a next frontier, along with ensuring proper desk height, chair height,\netc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is not great to get to this point. My hand posture and body posture at the\nkeyboard has been bad for years, and it has caught up to me. Learning the\nconnection with my elbow and ulnar nerve was very enlightening for my\nsituation. The common problem many people discuss is carpal tunnel related, but\nthe ulner is actually a relatively separate problem, though related in many\nways too.I recommend people be aware of contorting their hand or applying\npressure on their elbows too much, lest they suffer the same!</p>\n<h2 id=\"any-more-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#any-more-ideas\"><a href=\"#any-more-ideas\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Any more ideas?</h2>\n<p>Let me know of ways you take care of your hands (hardware, software, or\notherwise)</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#other-resources\"><a href=\"#other-resources\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Other resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>See this post by Matt Might for some more resources\n<a href=\"https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/\">https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ulnar tunnel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_tunnel_syndrome\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_tunnel_syndrome</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"extenuating-circumstances\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#extenuating-circumstances\"><a href=\"#extenuating-circumstances\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Extenuating circumstances</h2>\n<p>I am not sure if it really affects my typing, but I was bitten by a dog several\nyears ago. The dog clamped down on both my hands one after the other and got my\nleft especially bad, which required stitches. One fairly deep puncture was on\nthe left side of my left hand, which could plausibly affect my pinky, but\nergonomics other factors more relevant.</p>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
