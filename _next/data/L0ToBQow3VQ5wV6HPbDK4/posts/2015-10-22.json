{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Killing postgres the hard way","date":"2015-10-22","slug":"2015-10-22","content":"<p>So today, I finally decided to do something about a query that we saw\nhad been running for 25 DAYS on our server</p>\n<p>Note: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup\nyour data first if possible.</p>\n<p>First I could obviously see the culprit: each postgress query runs it's\nown process so I could see in \"htop\" that there was this process that\nhad been running for 600 hours, or about 25 days</p>\n<p>Next, I opened a psql console and ran this query:</p>\n<pre><code>> SELECT datname,procpid,current_query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE\n> datname='database_name' ORDER BY procpid ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any\ngiven time.  I could easily see the one problematic query being run,\nwhich was a badly constructed intermine template query that resulted in\na weird \"recursion\" essentially.</p>\n<p>I wanted to try just terminating this query itself, so I ran this</p>\n<pre><code>> SELECT pg_cancel_backend(29033);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each time I ran it, it would say it returned one result but it did\nnothing.</p>\n<p>I also read that you can try to nicely \"kill\" it from the command line\n(no kill -9) so I ran</p>\n<pre><code>> kill 29033\n</code></pre>\n<p>This also did not work!</p>\n<p>I thought perhaps all these problems were because tomcat was still\nactive, so we shut down tomcat, and retried killing the specific query,\nbut to no avail</p>\n<p>At this point, I just wanted to restart the whole database server. Kind\nof a risky move... but I am sort of a risky kind of guy...(that is not a\ngood thing with databases). If you are doing this, make backups! I\ndidn't. Luckily I suffered no data loss but what follows is kind of\nintense.</p>\n<p>So first, I try and stop the database service</p>\n<pre><code>> service postgresql-9.1 stop\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately, this <code>[FAILED]</code> ! And of course, even though it failed,\nthe database is now unusable. No logging into it anymore, we have to go\nwith the hard way now...</p>\n<p>Looking at /etc/init.d/postgres-9.1 told me that the service stop\ncommand was effectively using something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m fast stop\n</code></pre>\n<p>After some reading, I learned that you can try using a slightly\ndifferent flag to restart it</p>\n<pre><code>> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m immediate  stop\n</code></pre>\n<p>I ran this and to my horror/surprise, it actually worked! At this point\nI decided to start postgresql back up again!</p>\n<pre><code>> service postgresql-9.1 start\n</code></pre>\n<p>The service start quickly returned a SUCCESS, which was great, but then\nI tried to start a psql console and the console froze on me! I could not\neven ctrl+c it!</p>\n<p>I got really worried at this point and I looked at the process manager,\nand saw that there was one postmaster process running but it was not\nclear what it was doing. I actually tried to shutdown the server again\nin a panic mode but at this point it said</p>\n<pre><code>> /usr/pgsql-9.1/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /db/postgres/data/ -m immediate\n> waiting for server to shut\n> down...............................................................\n> failed\n</code></pre>\n<p>It was probably good that it didn't shut down, because I would quickly\nfind out that it was in recovery mode.  I looked at the postgresql logs\nand I saw this, reproduced here for full detail (from before the\nshutdown to the restart)</p>\n<pre><code>> WARNING:  pgstat wait timeout\n> WARNING:

stop using -m fast</li>\n<li>then the database stop using -m immediate</li>\n<li>the restart (with the HINT, should be ready soon)</li>\n<li>the panic mode where i tried to shut it again anyways</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the recovery period, I was still very concerned about the\ndatabase was doing, so I used \"strace\" to look at the main postmaster\nprocess.</p>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the postmaster process was just\ncleaning up files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/, I could see the\nfile system \"unlink\" command with successful status codes.</p>\n<p>There were about 150 large files in /db/postgres/data/base/pgsql_tmp/,\nand I waited about an hour for them to be deleted, and after that, the\npostgresql log file said it was ready, and indeed, it was perfect :)</p>\n<pre><code>> LOG:  redo is not required\n> LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections\n> LOG:  autovacuum launcher started\n</code></pre>\n<p>What a relief!</p>\n<p>I hope this might help any wayward stragglers to see how the postgresql\nrestart process works. Sometimes things don't shut down cleanly, but I\nthink it is still good to know some alternative steps to kill -9</p>\n<p>::: {#footer}\n[ October 22nd, 2015 7:29pm ]{#timestamp} [postgresql]{.tag} [dba]{.tag}\n[databases]{.tag} [sql]{.tag} [troubleshooting]{.tag}\n:::</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
