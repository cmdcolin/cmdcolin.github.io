{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Installing clamav on OSX","date":"2016-06-20","slug":"2016-06-20","html":"<p>It is a common trope that OSX doesn't need anti-virus because everyone targets\nwindows. That is maybe comforting to some but I think it's pretty naive. It\nwould be better to have a system on your machine to tell you about viruses,\ntrojan horses, malware, or spying. I have decided to employ a free open source\nscanner called clamAV <a href=\"https://www.clamav.net/\">https://www.clamav.net/</a>. I don't really know if it has\nany good features for Mac scanning but thought it could be fun to install</p>\n<p>ClamAV is the top choice for linux based OSs being free and open source (GPL)\nvirus scanner.</p>\n<p>To install we can use homebrew</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre>    $ brew install clamav\n</pre></div>\n<p>Then there is s config file to setup. This is located\nin /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf</p>\n<p>To setup, edit this file and delete the line that says \"Example\" and\nthen uncheck the desired settings. I would chose to enable logging to\n/var/log/clamav.log and also database directories in /var/lib/clamav</p>\n<p>Then run the \"freshclam\" program</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre>    $ freshclam\n</pre></div>\n<p>This will download the virus scanner database (main) and daily scanning\nupdates</p>\n<p>Then you can run clamscan on a given directory (recursively, only print\ninfected files)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre>    $ clamscan -ri <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/\n</pre></div>\n<p>Or add this to a cronjob</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre>    $ crontab -\n\n    @hourly clamscan -ri <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/ <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> mail -v -s <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>clamscan results<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> your.email@gmail.com  <span class=\"pl-k\">></span>/dev/null <span class=\"pl-k\">2>&#x26;1</span>\n\n</pre></div>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
