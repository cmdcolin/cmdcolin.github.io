I stepped to using <code>gtk4-rs</code> directly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-spreadsheet-style-data-grid-of-tracks-with-columnview\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#create-a-spreadsheet-style-data-grid-of-tracks-with-columnview\"><a href=\"#create-a-spreadsheet-style-data-grid-of-tracks-with-columnview\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Create a \"spreadsheet style\" data grid of tracks with <code>ColumnView</code></h3>\n<p>Then, I wanted to create a data grid showing to display e.g. a table with\nartist, track, album, etc. I chose to use the GTK\n<a href=\"https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ColumnView.html\"><code>ColumnView</code></a> to drive this.\nI stumbled around looking for example code, but there was none specifically for\nthe <code>ColumnView</code>. I also realized the <code>ListView</code> example from the <code>gtk4-rs</code>\nexamples with it's factory function had similar needs that the <code>ColumnView</code>.</p>\n<p>I found out that I basically needed to create a <code>ListStore</code>. I thought if\nI could make my own <code>GObject</code> subclass, it would solve everything, but I had\ntrouble getting making this work (rust doesn't have the concept of extending a\nclass for one thing, you implement various traits instead). Finally, I randomly\nstumbled on this link using a <code>BoxedAnyObject</code> with a good example of storing\ndata in a ListStore\n<a href=\"https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html\">https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.BoxedAnyObject.html</a></p>\n<p>The <code>BoxedAnyObject</code> is a <code>GObject</code>, so this was an good route to storing the\n<code>ListView</code> items. There was no example code for connecting the <code>ListStore</code> with\nthe <code>ColumnView</code>, so I stuggled for awhile before realizing that the <code>ListView</code>\nexample in the <code>gtk4-rs</code> codebase has similar concepts.</p>\n<p>See [1] for minimal usage of <code>ColumnView</code> that I contributed to the <code>gtk4-rs</code>\nrepo!</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosing-an-audio-library\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#choosing-an-audio-library\"><a href=\"#choosing-an-audio-library\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Choosing an audio library</h3>\n<p>To actually play audio, I looked at a couple options. There was even one option\ncalled GTK\n<a href=\"https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gtk4/struct.MediaFile.html\"><code>MediaFile</code></a>\nwhich should to be able to play e.g. mp3s, making my job of making a media\nplayer much simpler, but it produced an error <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;oq=%22GTK+could+not+find+a+media+module.+Check+your+installation.%22&#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57.267j0j7&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8\">\"GTK could not find a media\nmodule. Check your\ninstallation.\"</a>\nwhich had very few references on the internet. I figured this could be\ndifficult to solve or point to issues I could face later on making minimal\nexecutables for users.</p>\n<p>So, next I tried out <code>symphonia</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/\">https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/</a>).\nSymphonia requires a lot more code to work (~1000 lines so far, copying from\nthe <code>symphonia-play</code> example) but it has broad file format support, pure-rust\naudio stack, etc. I got confused about how to package it into an easy-to-use system though, having to create a symphonia player on a separate thread, so I looked elsewhere...</p>\n<p>Next I turned to <code>rodio</code>. This works well, and automatically plays on a\nseparate thread, but I found two issues 1) I have to initialize the rodio\nplayer in \"fn main\" and not anywhere else, or it would just play a short blip\nof audio (<a href=\"https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/381\">https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/381</a>). Then, it turned out\nthat the <code>rodio</code>\n<a href=\"https://docs.rs/rodio/0.14.0/rodio/struct.Sink.html#method.stop\"><code>Sink</code></a>\ninstance (which you pass audio to) cannot stop and then play new song xref\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/315\">https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/issues/315</a>). To workaround, I replace it\nwith a new <code>Sink</code>.</p>\n<p>This required me to learn about <code>RefCell</code>. I googled probably about 50 things\njust grasping at straws for awhile, but then landed on the solution of putting\nthe <code>Sink</code> in a <code>Rc&#x3C;RefCell&#x3C;Sink>></code>, then that allows me to pass it into my\ncallback that handles double clicking the songs in the <code>ColumnView</code>, and then I\nborrow the <code>RefCell</code> mutably to replace it with a new <code>Sink</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reading-audio-metadata-into-an-sqlite-db\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#reading-audio-metadata-into-an-sqlite-db\"><a href=\"#reading-audio-metadata-into-an-sqlite-db\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Reading audio metadata into an <code>sqlite</code> DB</h3>\n<p>I also wanted to have the option of reading and writing audio metadata.\nSymphonia only reads metadata, so I found the <code>lofty</code> crate.</p>\n<p>I also realized that reading tens of thousands of file's metadata at each app\nstartup would be slow, so I endeavored to store that data in an <code>sqlite</code>\ndatabase. I found that music players like <code>foobar2000</code> and <code>0xdeadbeef</code> have\ndatabases of track metadata also (Example folder on <code>foobar2000</code> (1.x) for this\nsnap/foobar2000/433/foobar2000/profile/library/74E45640B1C695CC/meta-0001,\nmeta-0002, etc.)</p>\n<p>I used the <code>walkdir</code> crate to walk a directory for files, <code>lofty</code> to read the\nmetadata, and then finally inserted the data into the <code>sqlite</code> db.

When consumers of\nthe package import the module, they would receive <code>pkg/index.js</code> from the\n<code>main</code> field in <code>package.json</code>, and then <code>pkg/index.js</code> in turn imports the\n<code>index.wasm</code> file. Then it is up to the consumers bundler to package that\ncorrectly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"footnote-2-bundlers-and-wasm\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-2-bundlers-and-wasm\"><a href=\"#footnote-2-bundlers-and-wasm\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Footnote 2: Bundlers and wasm</h2>\n<p>As of writing, I am using <code>webpack</code> v5 (part of <code>create-react-app</code> v5), which has\n\"native support\" for wasm. Still, it is hidden behind a flag called\n\"experiments\" (see first google result for webpack wasm here\n<a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/configuration/experiments/\">https://webpack.js.org/configuration/experiments/</a>) so I use <code>@craco/craco</code> to\nmodify the <code>webpack</code> config of <code>create-react-app</code> v5 to add this.</p>\n<p>Note also: The first time I wrote this, I used <code>webpack</code> v4, which used a\nslightly different workflow (used a special <code>webpack</code> loader called\n<code>wasm-loader</code>)</p>\n<p>You can also likely use similar techniques described in this article to\nincorporate into <code>next.js</code> since it also uses <code>webpack</code>.

If anyone\nhas more info, feel free to leave a comment!</p>\n<h2 id=\"footnote-4-build-setup\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-4-build-setup\"><a href=\"#footnote-4-build-setup\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Footnote 4: Build setup</h2>\n<p>The <code>hello-wasm</code> package does not automatically recompile when we are running\ne.g. <code>yarn start</code> in the <code>app</code> folder. Therefore, changes to the rust requires\nyou to manually run <code>yarn build</code> in the <code>hello-wasm</code> folder. Just something to\nbe aware of</p>\n<h2 id=\"footnote-5-my-first-experience-with-trying-to-make-this-work-was-rocky\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-5-my-first-experience-with-trying-to-make-this-work-was-rocky\"><a href=\"#footnote-5-my-first-experience-with-trying-to-make-this-work-was-rocky\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Footnote 5: My first experience with trying to make this work was rocky!</h2>\n<p>I first created an example of rust+wasm+react almost two years ago when\ncreating a fractal viewer\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map\">https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map</a>\nand it has some development notes on the stumbling blocks I faced\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map/blob/master/NOTES.md\">https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map/blob/master/NOTES.md</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"footnote-6-i-thought-you-said-typescript-too\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-6-i-thought-you-said-typescript-too\"><a href=\"#footnote-6-i-thought-you-said-typescript-too\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Footnote 6: I thought you said typescript too</h2>\n<p>Yep! The <code>hello-wasm</code> example generates typescript <code>.d.ts</code> files! Check out the\n<code>hello-wasm/pkg/</code> folder after you build it! This was none of my doing, just a\nbuilt-in feature. PS: I highly recommend inspecting the <code>pkg</code> folder that is\nproduced in the <code>hello-wasm</code> build to help understand the details. I also\nrecommend reading the <a href=\"https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/\">https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/</a> docs and if you\nare getting started with rust, read the Rust Book along with doing rustlings\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"footnote-7-another-resource\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-7-another-resource\"><a href=\"#footnote-7-another-resource\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Footnote 7: Another resource</h2>\n<p>This article was posted on reddit and is also a great resource especially about\nsync vs async webpack loading schemes for wasm</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://canvasapp.com/blog/building-modern-web-apps-with-rust-wasm-and-webpack/\">https://canvasapp.com/blog/building-modern-web-apps-with-rust-wasm-and-webpack/</a></p>"},{"title":"Photos of vacation","date":"2022-08-21","slug":"2022-08-21-vacation","html":"<p>From Aug 1st->Aug 18 I did a road trip from the South Carolina to New Mexico.

This can\ncause issues sometimes called \"ulnar tunnel\" or \"cubital tunnel\" which is\nrelatively distinct from \"carpal tunnel\" and is more strongly related to the\nring and pinky fingers! You can get ring/pinky pain from compression of the\nnerve near the wrist or near the elbow, but the elbow is quite common.</p>\n<p>Some notes about improving elbow ergonomics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid applying too much pressure to elbows on armrests (ulnar nerve) while at\ndesk</li>\n<li>Avoid typing with elbows bent e.g. straighten arms</li>\n<li>Avoid sleeping with elbows super bent e.g. I get this sleeping on my stomach\nwith my elbows under my body. Use ulnar/elbow brace for sleeping. I am\nordering one of these to try out</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"technical-approaches-and-key-remappings-for-pinky-ergonomics\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#technical-approaches-and-key-remappings-for-pinky-ergonomics\"><a href=\"#technical-approaches-and-key-remappings-for-pinky-ergonomics\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Technical approaches and key remappings for pinky ergonomics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remap caps lock to left+ctrl. This is a common one you hear recommended and\nit may help, and it has less contortion, particularly for chrome with one\nhand use. So you can say capslock+w, capslock+t, but it is still using pinky\nand can be stressful if not careful (capslock+w fine, capslock+t still\ncontortion if done with one hand)</li>\n<li>More use of the right-hand-only shortcuts or at least avoiding using the left\npinky for shortcuts. I don't have many of these but will look into retraining\nmyself for some of these. I am testing out right ctrl+] for leader in tmux,\nand - and = for split window horizontal and vertical</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\"><a href=\"#things-still-to-try-better-ergonomics-and-gadgets\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Things still to try: better ergonomics and gadgets</h3>\n<p>In truth, I type a lot on a laptop with a poor keyboard layout, and often use\nit away from a desk. I think improving my desk ergonomics could help, and\ngetting a fancy keyboard and maybe mouse (though I much prefer a touchpad)\ncould be a next frontier, along with ensuring proper desk height, chair height,\netc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is not great to get to this point. My hand posture and body posture at the\nkeyboard has been bad for years, and it has caught up to me. Learning the\nconnection with my elbow and ulnar nerve was very enlightening for my\nsituation. The common problem many people discuss is carpal tunnel related, but\nthe ulnar is actually a relatively separate problem, though related in many\nways too. I recommend people be aware of contorting their hand or applying\npressure on their elbows too much, lest they suffer the same!</p>\n<h2 id=\"any-more-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#any-more-ideas\"><a href=\"#any-more-ideas\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Any more ideas?</h2>\n<p>Let me know of ways you take care of your hands (hardware, software, or\notherwise)</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#other-resources\"><a href=\"#other-resources\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Other resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>See this post by Matt Might for some more resources\n<a href=\"https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/\">https://matt.might.net/articles/preventing-and-managing-rsi/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ulnar tunnel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_tunnel_syndrome\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_tunnel_syndrome</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"You may not need a bundler for your NPM library","date":"2022-05-27","slug":"2022-05-27-youmaynotneedabundler","html":"<p>I have seen a couple threads on twitter where people complain about the\ndifficulty with publishing NPM libraries or ask what starter kit they should\nuse (or, people recommended starter packs anyways)</p>\n<p>Example threads</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1513903035197526017\">https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1513903035197526017</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/oleg008/status/1510006191296061441\">https://twitter.com/oleg008/status/1510006191296061441</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/iansu/status/1524860613943382017\">https://twitter.com/iansu/status/1524860613943382017</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1525075901905522691\">https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1525075901905522691</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing that is notable to me in these threads is that people often recommend\nthat you use a bundler (a program that combines multiple src files into a\nsingle or fewer output files) when developing a library</p>\n<p>Examples of starter packs suggested in these threads that use bundlers</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>microbundle</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/developit/microbundle\">https://github.com/developit/microbundle</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>esno</code> - <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/esno\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/esno</a> - uses esbuild</li>\n<li><code>unbuild</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/unjs/unbuild\">https://github.com/unjs/unbuild</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>preconstruct</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/preconstruct/preconstruct\">https://github.com/preconstruct/preconstruct</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>tsup</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/egoist/tsup\">https://github.com/egoist/tsup</a> - uses esbuild</li>\n<li><code>tsdx</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx\">https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>vite library mode</code> - <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode\">https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>packemon</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/milesj/packemon\">https://github.com/milesj/packemon</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>ts-library-template</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/shortercode/ts-library-template\">https://github.com/shortercode/ts-library-template</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>parcel</code> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1524944991402999810\">https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1524944991402999810</a> - uses parcel</li>\n<li><code>dts</code> - <a href=\"https://weiran-zsd.github.io/dts-cli/\">https://weiran-zsd.github.io/dts-cli/</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>pkgroll</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/privatenumber/pkgroll\">https://github.com/privatenumber/pkgroll</a> - uses rollup</li>\n<li><code>mkdist</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/unjs/mkdist\">https://github.com/unjs/mkdist</a> - referenced by <code>unbuild</code>, uses esbuild</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not using bundlers</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gts</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gts\">https://github.com/google/gts</a></li>\n<li><code>ts-react-toolbox</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/zzarcon/ts-react-toolbox/\">https://github.com/zzarcon/ts-react-toolbox/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary 2/15 do not use a bundler, 13/15 do use a bundler.

If the library uses a bundler:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the best case, it has no impact on the consumer</li>\n<li>in the worst case, it affects the complexity of your library and makes\npossible limitations for your consumers also.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example where it can actually create limitations, you might consider code\nsplitting with async <code>import()</code>. If you create a single file bundle, then the\nconsumer of your library may not be able to do code splitting properly via\nasync <code>import()</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-would-you-maybe-want-a-bundler-for-your-library\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#why-would-you-maybe-want-a-bundler-for-your-library\"><a href=\"#why-would-you-maybe-want-a-bundler-for-your-library\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Why would you <em>MAYBE</em> want a bundler for your library</h2>\n<p>If you really care about producing a <code>UMD</code> bundle that can be used in a script\ntag, maybe you want a bundler, but the future does not seem to be in <code>UMD</code>.\nOne other possible bundle type is maybe you like the idea of a single file\n<code>ESM</code> module. It is similar where you could maybe reference this from a script\ntag with type module, but this seems like a niche usage.

It tells\nyou about insertions, deletions, and clipping. It is a series of \"operators\"\nwith lengths.</p>\n<p>Insertion example:</p>\n<p><code>50M50I50M</code></p>\n<p>That would be 50bp of matching bases (<code>50M</code>), followed by a 50bp insertion\n(<code>50I</code>), followed by another 50bp of matches (<code>50M</code>). The 50bp insertion means\nthe read contains 50 bases in the middle which did not match the reference\ngenome that you are comparing the read to.</p>\n<p>Clipping example:</p>\n<p><code>50S50M50S</code></p>\n<p>This means that 50bp matched (<code>50M</code> in the middle of the <code>CIGAR</code> string) and\nboth sides of the read are soft clipped. The clipping means the aligner was not\nable to align the reads on either side. You could imagine clipping being like\n\"an insertion on either side of the read\" if you like: basically those bases on\neither side did not align.</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Finding mismatches</em>: A <code>CIGAR</code> string match like <code>50M</code> means 50 bases\n\"matched\" the reference genome, but that only means that there are no\ninsertions or deletions in those 50 bases. There could be underlying\nmismatches in the read compared to the reference. Note: there is also\nextended <code>CIGAR</code> that replaces <code>M</code> with <code>=</code> (exact match) and <code>X</code> (mismatch).\nAlso see Appendix D on the <code>MD</code> tag and finding where the mismatches are, but\nnote that <code>MD</code> tag is tricky</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Ambiguity of representation</em>: A <code>CIGAR</code> string with insertions and deletions\ncould be <code>50M1D1I50M</code>. This string had a 1bp deletion and a 1bp insertion\nback-to-back. This could be just a mismatch! There is ambiguity in sequence\nalignment representations. Downstream programs must accomodate this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Split records and soft-clipping</em>: A <code>CIGAR</code> string with soft-clipping\n<code>500S50M</code> this means that 500 bases of the read were not aligned at this\nposition, but 50 bases were! Note that the alignment might have been a split\nalignment (see section on split alignments below) so another record in the\n<code>SAM</code> file, linked by the <code>SA</code> (supplementary alignment) tag, might contain\ninfo on where the other 500 bases aligned! (or, they might not map anywhere).\nThe linked split or supplementary alignments all have the same read name\n(<code>QNAME</code>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf\">SAMv1.pdf</a> for all the\nCIGAR operators.</p>\n<p>If you are working with <code>SAM</code> data, you will often write loops that directly\nparse CIGAR strings.

The \"primary\" record generally has a\n<code>SEQ</code> field that represents the entirety of the original read's sequence (with\nCIGAR soft clipping operators saying which part of that sequence aligned), and\nthe \"supplementary alignments\" will have <code>SEQ</code> field but sometimes just\nsegments of the original read's sequence with CIGAR hard clipping operators\nindicating that it is partial.</p>\n<p>Supplementary alignments are especially common with long reads, and it can be a\nsignal for structural variants e.g. where two chromosomes are fused together,\nand parts of the read align to multiple chromosomes, or the split alignment may\nalign to either side of a large deletion, or they may be split to align through\nan inversion (part of it aligns to the forward strand, part of it to the\nreverse strand, and again the forward strand)</p>\n<p>There is no limitation on how many splits might occur so the split can align to\n3, 4, or more different places.

In the future, SV visualization may\nlook more similar to comparative genomics, where we compare an SV to a\npopulation specific reference from a graph genomes or something like this.</p>\n<p>It is known that <em>de novo</em> assembly has more power to detect SVs than some read\noperations (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lh3lh3/status/1362921612690010118/photo/1\">https://twitter.com/lh3lh3/status/1362921612690010118/photo/1</a>\nas <em>de novo</em> assembled genomes improve and become more widespread, we may see a\nshift in how SVs are called</p>\n<p>I would also like to see improved ability to do fast or 'on the fly' gene\nprediction on the <em>de novo</em> assembled genomes, and we can see what SNPs or\nmodified splicing might look like in copies of genes (e.g. derived regions of\nthe CNV duplications).</p>\n<p>Fun fact: the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/lh3/gfatools/blob/master/doc/rGFA.md#the-graph-alignment-format-gaf\"><code>GAF</code></a>\n(graphical alignment format) is a strict superset of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md\"><code>PAF</code></a> (pairwise alignment\nformat) by storing graph node labels in the <code>target name</code> slot of <code>PAF</code>, and\ncan refer to an <code>rGFA</code> (reference genome graph)!

tell you where the mismatches are without looking at the\nreference genome. This is useful because as I mentioned, <code>CIGAR</code> can say <code>50M</code>\n(50 matches) but some letters inside those 50 matches can be mismatches, it\nonly says there are no insertions/deletions in those 50 bases, but you have to\ndetermine where in those 50 bases where the mismatches are. The <code>MD</code> tag can\nhelp tell you where those are, but it is somewhat complicated to decode\n(<a href=\"https://vincebuffalo.com/notes/2014/01/17/md-tags-in-bam-files.html\">https://vincebuffalo.com/notes/2014/01/17/md-tags-in-bam-files.html</a>).\nYou have to combine it with the <code>CIGAR</code> to get the position of the mismatches\non the reference genome. If you have a reference genome to look at, you might\njust compare all the bases within the 50M to the reference genome and look for\nmismatches yourself and forget about the <code>MD</code> tag</p>\n<p>The <code>MD</code> tag is also not required to exist, but the command <code>samtools calmd yourfile.bam --reference reference.fa</code> can add <code>MD</code> tags to your <code>BAM</code> file. It\nis generally not useful for <code>CRAM</code> because <code>CRAM</code> actually does store\nmismatches with the reference genome in it's compression format. Note that\nthere are also some oddities about <code>MD</code> tag representation leading to\ncomplaints (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/issues/505\">https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/issues/505</a>) leading more\ncredence to \"doing it yourself\" e.g. finding your own mismatches\nby comparing the read sequence with the reference, keeping track of where you\nare on the read and ref position with the <code>CIGAR</code> string (a la Appendix B)</p>"},{"title":"How to make your own npm package with typescript","date":"2021-12-31","slug":"2021-12-31-npm-package","html":"<p>There is a lot of mystery around making your own <code>npm</code> package.

This package does not use any bundling (rollup or webpack or otherwise).\nIt just uses <code>tsc</code> is used to compile the files to the <code>dist</code> folder, and the\ndist folder is published to <code>npm</code>! If you need your package to be usable by\nconsumers that don't themselves use bundlers, consider looking into <code>&#x3C;script type=\"module\"></code> for importing ESM modules in the browser, or you can bundle\nyour library using rollup or webpack and output e.g. a UMD bundle</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-product\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#final-product\"><a href=\"#final-product\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Final product</h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/cmdcolin/npm-package-tutorial/\">https://github.com/cmdcolin/npm-package-tutorial/</a></p>"},{"title":"My next.js static blog setup","date":"2021-12-26","slug":"2021-12-26-nextjs","html":"<p>TLDR src here <a href=\"https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io\">https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io</a></p>\n<p>My personal homepage originally used statocles, a perl-based static site\ngenerator (<a href=\"http://preaction.me/statocles/\">http://preaction.me/statocles/</a>).

I can confirm that 2^24 is the maximum number of entries in\na Map. That’s not a bug, it’s just the implementation-defined limit.\n\nThe limit is determined by:\n\nThe FixedArray backing store of the Map has a maximum size of 1GB (independent\nof the overall heap size limit) On a 64-bit system that means 1GB / 8B = 2^30 /\n2^3 = 2^27 ~= 134M maximum elements per FixedArray A Map needs 3 elements per\nentry (key, value, next bucket link), and has a maximum load factor of 50% (to\navoid the slowdown caused by many bucket collisions), and its capacity must be\na power of 2. 2^27 / (3 * 2) rounded down to the next power of 2 is 2^24, which\nis the limit you observe.  FWIW, there are limits to everything: besides the\nmaximum heap size, there’s a maximum String length, a maximum Array length, a\nmaximum ArrayBuffer length, a maximum BigInt size, a maximum stack size, etc.\nAny one of those limits is potentially debatable, and sometimes it makes sense\nto raise them, but the limits as such will remain. Off the top of my head I\ndon’t know what it would take to bump this particular limit by, say, a factor\nof two – and I also don’t know whether a factor of two would be enough to\nsatisfy your expectations.\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Great details there. It would also be good to know what the behavior is for the\nObject, which has those 100% CPU stalls after ~8.3M, but not the same error\nmessage...</p>\n<p>Another fun note: if I modify the Object code to use only “integer IDs” the\ncode actually works fine, does not hit any errors, and is “blazingly fast” as\nthe kids call it</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">const</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">myObject</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">=</span> {}\n<span class=\"pl-k\">for</span> (<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> i <span class=\"pl-k\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">0</span>; i <span class=\"pl-k\">&#x3C;=</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">50_000_000</span>; i<span class=\"pl-k\">++</span>) {\n  myObject[i] <span class=\"pl-k\">=</span> i\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> (i <span class=\"pl-k\">%</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">100000</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">==</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">0</span>) {\n    <span class=\"pl-en\">console</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">log</span>(i)\n  }\n}\n</pre></div>\n<p>I presume that this code works because it detects that I’m using it like an\narray and it decides to transform how it is working internally and not use a\nhash-map-style data structure, so does not hit a limit.

They decided they are going to do \"the big rewrite\" and are going to\nuse React. I start out as a remote worker. I fly into Berkeley for a single day\nto sign HR paperwork!</p>\n<p>Soon, my coworker starts building the new React app prototype. He keeps asking\nme what state management library should we use, but I had no idea about React\nstill, much less what state management even is, and basically just was like \"I\ndunno!\". I had no way to form an opinion.</p>\n<p>I was also working on some stuff unrelated to the rewrite as the rest of the\nteam started prototyping in React, and I remained pretty out of the loop. We\nwould have weekly meetings but I just wouldn't really understand the goings\nons. I saw PropTypes, and mobx-state-tree model types, and class-based React\ncomponents, but nothing sunk in.</p>\n<p>Sidenote: I had actually tried out React in 2016 and was very confused at that\ntime too, I had a bad taste in my mouth about React entirely!

By the end of January 2019 I get my first code change merged.</p>\n<p>I also suggested that we start doing <strong>pair-programming sessions</strong>. Once I\nstarted doing this, meeting weekly with my coworkers, it made a huge difference\nfor me in learning how to code. The things we discussed in these sessions often\nstill went way over my head due to how my coworkers presented stuff or how much\nthey assumed I understood.

Reading this book was a big help I felt, and provided a needed \"brain\nreset\" for me. The book worked well for me, I read it each night on my kindle.\nThe book was good at showing how things like ES6 syntax like destructuring,\narrow functions, etc help fit into the React ecosystem (I was still steeped in\nES5). Also, with the book, I could focus, not have distractions, etc. My eyes\nwould just glaze over every time I clicked on internet tutorials. I did not try\nto live code any of the examples of \"Learning React\", I just read it as is\nbefore bed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process\"><a href=\"#applying-lessons-to-work-is-still-a-slow-going-process\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Applying lessons to work is still a slow going process</h2>\n<p>So anyways, work goes on, and I'm learning, but our codebase still feels pretty\ncomplicated and alien. React is one thing, but mobx is another. I tried\ndownloading the mobx-state-tree book but it goes over my head\n(<a href=\"https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781789344837/8/ch08lvl1sec47/an-opinionated-mobx-with-mobx-state-tree\">https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web-development/9781789344837/8/ch08lvl1sec47/an-opinionated-mobx-with-mobx-state-tree</a>)\nand the way mobx is glued to React via mobx-react doesn't really click. I\nremember asking my coworkers why my component was not updating and they\neventually find out it's because I keep not using the observer() wrapper around\nmy components, which is obvious when you understand the system but it stumped\nme as a learner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-out-typescript\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#trying-out-typescript\"><a href=\"#trying-out-typescript\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Trying out Typescript</h2>\n<p>In April 2019, I start to experiment with Typescript and release a Typescript\nversion of some data parsing code.

It worked well. I\ncouldn't really figure out why I would use it instead of using mobx for state\nmanagement we used elsewhere, but the example was that it was a click-and-drag\nand it made sense to keep that click-and-drag mouse position state local to the\ncomponent rather than the \"app\".</p>\n<p>The book \"Learning React\" also helped me to understand hooks but only\nindirectly. The book had examples of pure function components, but was written\npre-hooks. With hooks added in React 16.8, it took a little brain exercising,\nbut I understood how hooks can be applied to function components.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-react-testing-library\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#using-react-testing-library\"><a href=\"#using-react-testing-library\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Using <code>react-testing-library</code></h2>\n<p>In June 2019, I create \"integration test\" level tests for our app. I had used\n<code>react-testing-library</code> for some components before this, but this was using\n<code>react-testing-library</code> to render the entire \"app level\" component. I was happy\nto pioneer this and was happy to try this out instead of doing true browser\ntests, and I think this has worked out well.</p>\n<p>Some caveats: I got very caught up with trying to do canvas tests initially. I\nreally wanted to use <code>jest-mock-canvas</code> but we were using <code>OffscreenCanvas</code> via\na pretty complicated string of things, so I don't make progress here, and I\nalso got confused about the relationship between <code>node-canvas</code> and\n<code>jest-mock-canvas</code> (they are basically totally different approaches). Later on, I\nfind using <code>jest-image-snapsho</code>t of the canvas contents works nice (ref\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33269093/how-to-add-canvas-support-to-my-tests-in-jest\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33269093/how-to-add-canvas-support-to-my-tests-in-jest</a>)</p>\n<p>Other random note: when building out the integration tests, we got a lot\nof \"act warnings\" which were confusing. These were fixed in React 16.9\n(released August 2019), but we had to ignore them and they basically just\nconfused me a lot and made it feel like I was battling a very complex system\nrather than a nice simple one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#conclusions\"><a href=\"#conclusions\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Overall, I just wanted to write up my whole experience.

If\nanyone else has had struggles learning React, tell your story, and let me know.\nI'd like to also thank everyone who helped me along the way.

I tried importing React via a CDN and\ngave it a shot, and it seemed simple enough, but I kept getting really confused\nabout how to even read and initialize the value of a textbox for example\nproperly. TLDR: I was not aware of what a <em>controlled component</em> was.</p>\n<p>The idea of controlled components (not a word in my vocabulary at the time) was\nquite unintuitive and instead, I kept googling weird things like \"two way data\nbinding react\" and variants of this. I had never used Angular but I heard of\ntwo-way data binding from Angular, and I just felt like it was what I needed. I\neven posted about my frustrations about this on the React subreddit and was\ndownvoted. Felt bad. I was just really confused.

I can't exactly say. I feel like I\nwas a competant developer, but I had some severer mental barriers to\nunderstanding the way React worked. I wish someone would have just told me\nsomething like \"React is basically like functions that can return HTML\" e.g.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">function</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">HelloWorld</span>() {\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">return</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">&#x3C;</span>div<span class=\"pl-k\">></span>Hello world<span class=\"pl-k\">&#x3C;/</span>div<span class=\"pl-k\">></span>\n}\n</pre></div>\n<p>Certainly there is more to it than that, but boiling it down to just that core\nidea I think would have helped me, and then walking me through some of the\nstuff slowly after I had that base understanding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"footnote-3\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-3\"><a href=\"#footnote-3\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Footnote 3</h2>\n<p>I am not sure if I would recommend Learning React to all learners.

I was involved\nin the project before then and knew it's ins and outs, and frankly think\nit's still a great system. In order to break it's \"limitations\" a grand\nv2 gets started. I think my team has been good. My tech lead is really\ngood at architecture. Where I really resist kind of \"writing new\narchitecture that is not already there\", he can pull up entirely new\nconcepts and abstractions that are all pretty good. Myself, I don't much\nenjoy writing \"new architecture\" if there is something already there\nthat I can use, and I'll try to refer to the existence of an existing\nthing instead of creating new exotic stuff.</p>\n<p>Now, what happened during the big rewrite so far. 4 people on the team,\n2 years in</p>\n<p>Persistent confusion about sources of slowness in our app</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it's only slow because devtools is open (maybe it is! but this is\ndefinitely a red herring. the code should work with devtools open.\nreason that's been stated: devtools adds a \"bunch of instrumentation to\nthe promises that slows it down\"...stated without any evidence during a\n3 hour long planning call...)\n<ul>\n<li>it's only slow because we're using a development build of react, try\na production build (the production build makes some stuff faster, but it\nis NOT going to save your butt if you are constantly rerending all your\ncomponents unnecessarily every millisecond during user scroll, which is\nsomething we suffered from, and it creeps back in if you are not careful\nbecause you can't write tests against this so often one day I'll be\nlooking at my devtools and suddenly things are rendering twice per frame\n(signature of calling an unnecessary setState), tons of unnecessary\ncomponents rendering in every frame (signature of\ncomponentShouldUpdate/bad functional react memoizing, etc))</li>\n<li>it's slow because we are hogging the main thread all the time, our\nkiller new feature in v2 is an intense webworker framework. now main\nthread contention is a concern, but really our app needs to just be\nperformant all around, webworkers just offloads that cpu spinning to\nanother core. what we have done in v2 is we went whole hog and made our\ncode rely on OffscreenCanvas which 0 browsers support. also, our\nwebworker bundles (worker-loader webpack build) are huge webpack things\nthat pretty much contain all the code that is on the main thread so it's\njust massive. that makes it slow at loading time, and makes it harder to\nthink about our worker threads in a lighter-weight way, and the worker\nconcept is now very deeply entrenched in a lot of the code (all code has\nto think of things in terms of rpc calls)</li>\n<li>it's slow because there are processes that haven't been aborted\nspinning in the background, so we must build out an intensive\nAbortController thing that touches the entirety of all our code\nincluding sending abort signals across the RPC boundary in hopes that a\nlocked up webworker will respond to this (note: our first version of the\nsoftware had zero aborting, did not from my perspective suffer.\narguments with the team have gotten accusatory where I just claim that\nthere is no evidence that the aborting is helping us, pointing to the\nfact that our old code works fine, and that if our new code suffers\nwithout aborting, that means something else is wrong.

There are a ton of little snippets in the release notes, you might\nas well just go ahead and upgrade, but what went into all those little fixes?\nGoing to the blog post has links to the github\nissues, <a href=\"http://jbrowse.org/blog/2018/12/13/jbrowse-1-16-0.html\">http://jbrowse.org/blog/2018/12/13/jbrowse-1-16-0.html</a> but I felt like\nmaybe I'd add a little more context for some of them:</p>\n<p>PS This is sort of motivated by @zcbenz blog on Electron\n(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zcbenz\">https://twitter.com/zcbenz</a> <a href=\"http://cheng.guru/\">http://cheng.guru/</a>) which tells the software in\nterms of actual commit messages and such.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>webpack</code> build doing a production build by default. This seems pretty\nstraightforward, but was also difficult because I use WSL and the UglifyJs\nplugin had trouble on WSL using the parallel: 4 option to use multiple\nprocessors. This was really annoying and resulted in the webpack build just\nhanging for no reason and only careful google-fu really uncovered other\npeople having this issue. I removed the parallelism as the speed gain wasn't\neven really justifiable <a href=\"https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1223\">https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/pull/1223</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The incorporation of the <code>@gmod/bam</code> module. This was an almost 2 months\nprocess after my first module, <code>@gmod/indexedfasta</code>. It required really\ngetting down to the binary level for BAM and was pretty tough. The module has\nalready itself had 12 releases\n<a href=\"https://github.com/GMOD/bam-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">here</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for indexing arbitrary fields from GFF3Tabix files. This was\nfairly straightforward but required making design decisions about this.\nPreviously flatfile-to-json.pl files would have a command line flag to index\narbitrary fields. Since gff3tabix files are specified via config, I allowed\nspecifying arbitrary fields via config.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added ability to render non-coding transcript types to the default Gene\nglyph. This one was a nice feature and enables you to see non-coding types, but\nrequired some weird design decisions because I could not override\nthe <code>box->style->color</code> from a higher level type simply using the\n<code>_defaultConfig</code> function, so I needed to override the <code>getStyle</code> callback that\nwas passed down to the lower levels, so that it was able to use the default\nlower level style and also our non-coding transcript style. See this part of\nthe code for\ndetails <a href=\"https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/commit/ec638ea1cc62c8727#diff-a14e88322d8f4e8e940f995417277878R22\">https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/commit/ec638ea1cc62c8727#diff-a14e88322d8f4e8e940f995417277878R22</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added <code>hideImproperPairs</code> filter. This was fairly straightforward but it is\none of these bugs that went unnoticed for years...the <code>hideMissingMatepairs</code>\nflag would hide things didn't have the sam 0x02 flag for \"read mapped in proper\npair\", but reads with this flag could still be paired. Doing the 1.16 release\nthat focused on paired reads helped focus on this issue and now\nhideMissingMatepairs filters on \"mate unmapped\" and <code>hideImproperPairs</code> is\nthe \"read mapped in proper pair\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added <code>useTS</code> flag. This one is fairly straightforward, it is similar to\n<code>useXS</code> which colors reads based on their alignment in canonical splice site\norientations. I figured I could just copy the <code>useXS</code> to the <code>useTS</code> since I\nfigured they are the same, but I went ahead and manually generated RNA-seq\nalignments with minimap2 and found that the useTS is actually flipped the\nopposite of <code>useXS</code>, so it was valuable to get actual test data here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed issue where some <code>generate-names</code> setups would fail to index features.\nThis was a bad bug that was brought to light by a user. I was kind of mind\nboggled when I saw it. In JBrowse 1.13-JBrowse 1.15 a change was introduced to\nname indexing with a memory leak. In JBrowse 1.15 that was removed. But, there\nwas another change where refseqs could return empty name records, because they\nwere handled separately. But if the initial fill up of the name buffer of 50000\nwas exceeded by the reference sequence, then there would be empty name records\nafter this point and cause the name indexing to stop. Therefore this bug would\nonly happen when the reference sequence indexing buffer exceeded 50000 items\nwhich could happen even when there are less than 50000 refseqs due to\nautocompletions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed issue with getting feature density from BAM files via the index stats\nestimation. This involved parsing the \"dummy bin\" from index files, and I found\nit was failing on certain 1000 genomes files. I actually don't really know what\nthe story behind this was, but our tabix code was better at parsing the dummy\nbins than my bam code, and it was the same concept, so I took a note from their\ncodebase to use it in bam-js code. Commit\nhere <a href=\"https://github.com/GMOD/bam-js/commit/d5796dfc8750378ac8b875615ae0a7e81371af76\">https://github.com/GMOD/bam-js/commit/d5796dfc8750378ac8b875615ae0a7e81371af76</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed issue with some GFF3Tabix tracks having some inconsistent layout of\nfeatures. This is a persistently annoying fact in tabix files where we cannot\nreally get a unique ID of a feature based on it's file offset. Therefore this\ntakes the full crc32 of a line as it's unique ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed CRAM store not renaming reference sequences in the same way as other\nstores. This one was interesting because rbuels made a fix but it caused\nfeatures from one chromosome to show up on the wrong ones, so chr1 reads\nwhere showing up on chrMT. This happened because it was falling back to the\nrefseq index if it chrMT wasn't in the embedded \"sam header\" in the CRAM\nfile, but it should only fallback to refseq index if there is not any\nembedded \"sam header\" in the CRAM file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed bug where older browsers e.g. IE11 were not being properly supported\nvia babel. This was a absolutely terrible bug that I found over thanksgiving\nbreak. It was a regression from 1.15 branch of JBrowse. Previous versions from\n1.13 when webpack was up until 1.15 used <code>@babel/env</code>. It was changed to\nbabel-preset-2015 but it was not being run correctly. Then I found that even if\nI did get it running correctly, it was unable to properly babel-ify the\nlru-cache module because it used something called\n<code>Object.defineProperty('length', ...)</code> to change how the length property was\nintepreted which was illegal in IE11. The 'util.promisify' NPM module also did\nthis in some contexts. I found that I could use the quick-lru module and the\nes6-promisify module instead of lru-cache and util.promisify as a workaround.\nThen I had to update all <code>@gmod/tabix</code>, <code>@gmod/vcf</code>, <code>@gmod/bgzf-filehandle</code>,\n<code>@gmod/indexedfasta</code>, <code>@gmod/tribble-index</code>, <code>@gmod/bam</code>, and JBrowse proper to\nuse these modules instead, and make the bable chain, which typically does not\nparse node_modules, to build these modules specifically (I didn't want to setup\nbabel toolchains for every single one of these modules, just one in the jbrowse\nmain codebase...). This was really a lot of work to support IE11 but now that\nworks so ...ya</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed bug where some files were not being fetched properly when changing\nrefseqs. This was actually fixed when I changed out lru-cache for quick-lru and\nfixed a bug where the cache size was set to 0 due to a erroneous comment that\nsaid <code>50*1024 // 50MB</code>...of course it should have said <code>50*1024*1024 // 50MB</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/commit/2025dc0aa0091b70\">https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/commit/2025dc0aa0091b70</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed issue where JBrowse would load the wrong area of the refseq on startup\nresulting in bad layouts and excessive data fetches. This was actually a\nheinous bug where jbrowse upon loading would just navigateTo the start of the\nreference sequence automatically and then to wherever was specified by the\nuser. This resulted in track data to start downloading immediately from the\nstart of the chromosome and resulted in for example 350 kilobases of\nreference sequence from all tracks to start downloading, which when I was\nimplementing view as pairs, was causing me to download over 100MB routinely.\nThis was terrible, and after fixing I only download about 10MB over even\nlarge regions for most BAM files. Additionally, this bug was causing the\ntrack heights to be calculated incorrectly because the track heights would\nactually be calculated based on distorted canvas\nbitmaps. <a href=\"https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1187\">https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse/issues/1187</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JBrowse Desktop was not fetching remote files. This was a weird issue where\nremote file requests were considered a CORS requests to any external remote.\nThis was solved by changing the usage of the fetch API in JBrowse for\nnode-fetch which does not obey CORS. Note that electron-fetch was also\nconsidered, which uses Chromiums network stack instead of node's, but that\nhad specific assumptions about the context in which it was called.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed issue where some parts of a CRAM file would not be displayed in\nJBrowse due to a CRAM index parsing issue. This was based on a sort of binary\nsearch that was implemented in JBrowse where the elements of the lists were\nnon-overlapping regions, and the query was a region, and the output should be a\nlist of the non-overlapping regions that overlap the query. Most algorithms for\nbinary search don't really tell you how to do searches on ranges so needed to\nroll up my sleeves and write a little custom code. An interval tree could have\nbeen used but this is too heavy-weight for non-overlapping regions from the\nindex <a href=\"https://github.com/GMOD/cram-js/pull/10\">https://github.com/GMOD/cram-js/pull/10</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where BAM features were not lazily evaluating their tags.\nWhen a function <code>feature.get('blahblah')</code> is called on a BAM feature, it checks\nto see if it's part of a default list of things that are parsed like feature\nstart, end, id, but if not, it has to parse all the BAM tags to see if it is a\ntag. Since they are called \"lazy features\" the tag processing is deferred until\nit is absolutely needed. As it turned out, the incorporation of CRAM in 1.15\nwas calling a function to try to get the CRAM's version of CIGAR/MD on the BAM\nfeatures unnecessarily invoking the tag parsing on every feature up front and\ntherefore making the feature not really lazy anymore. This restored\nthe \"lazyness\" aspect of BAM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed issue where CRAM layout and mouseover would be glitchy due to ID\ncollisions on features. In the 1.15 releases, CRAM was introduced, and we\nthought that the concept of taking CRC32 of the entire feature data days were\nover because there is the concept of a \"unique ID\" on the features. However,\nthis ID was only unique within the slices, so around the slice boundaries there\nwere a lot of bad feature layouts and mouseovers would fail because they would\nmap to multiple features, etc. I found a way to unique-ify this by giving it\nthe sliceHeader file offset. <a href=\"https://github.com/GMOD/cram-js/pull/10\">https://github.com/GMOD/cram-js/pull/10</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also had behind the scenes work by igv.js team member jrobinso who helped\non the CRAM codebase to incorporate a feature where for lossy read names, so\nthat a read and it's mate pair would consistently be assigned the same read\nname based on the unique ID mentioned above. There was also a rare issue\nwhere sometimes the mate pair's orientation was incorrectly reported based on\nthe CRAM flags, but the embedded BAM flags correctly reported it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally the paired reads feature. This was a feature that I really wanted to\nget right. It started when garrett and rbuels were going to san diego for the\nCIVIC hackathon, and we talked about doing something that matched a \"variant\nreview system\" that they had done for the IGV codebase, which involved\ndetailed inspection of reads. I thought it would probably be feasible for\njbrowse to do this, but I thought essentially at some point that enhancing\njbrowse's read visualizations with paired reads would be a big win. I had\nthought about this at the JBrowse hackathon also and my discussions then were\nthat this was very hard. Overall, I invented a compromise that I thought was\nreasonable which was that there can be a \"maxInsertSize\" for the pileup view\nbeyond which the pairing wouldn't be resolved. This allowed (a) a significant\nreduction in data fetches because I implemented a \"read redispatcher\" that\nwould actually literally resolve the read pairs in the separate chunks and\n(b) a cleaner view because the layout wouldn't be polluted by very long read\ninserts all the time and also, for example, if you scrolled to the right, and\nsuddenly a read was paired to the left side of your view, it would result in\na bad layout (but with max insert size, the window of all reads within\nmaxinsertsize are always resolved so this does not happen) and finally ( c)\nthe paired arc view was incorporated which does not use read redispatching\nand which can do very long reads. All of these things took time to think\nthrough and resolve, but it is now I think a pretty solid system and I look\nforward to user feedback!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"title":"Problems that I experienced with the HPCC","date":"2017-04-21","slug":"2017-04-21","html":"<p>Many of these issues may be due to me being stubborn with a weird build system.\nNonetheless, they were baffling, and I had very little interest in debugging\nthese issues.

I think this is interesting,\nand would generally agree that not everyone needs to achieve total automation\nof their whole pipeline, but I think the post does a lot of \"blaming your\ntools\" and disparaging good development practices with regards to version\ncontrol and figure generation.</p>\n<p>I think that the complaint that version control and automated figures are not\nfor everyone is probably true, but it is overgeneralizing a different problem.\nFor example, students are not \"trained\" to work with Git, and they are not\n\"trained\" to do software engineering. In fact, even computer science students\nare not generally \"trained\" to do any of those things (computer science !=\nsoftware engineering). But that doesn't mean that your lab needs to forego\nusing all those tools. Software development can be incredibly complex and\nsophisticated, but it's important to make sure things are \"done right\"!\nHigh-quality and easy-to-reproduce software is really about process, and\nengineering. But that is also why there is no one-true-way for\nreproducibility. Maybe Arjun doesn't have a reproducible workflow right now,\nbut what about 5 years down the road, where he suddenly has a great framework\nfor such things? This happens all the time in software development (for\nexample, how long ago was it that \"push to deploy\" did not exist? how often\nwould you just edit your files live on your site? now that is seen as bad\npractice!), but that said, processes for software quality can evolve pretty\norganically, so even though some best practices exist, people can grow their\nown quality environment.</p>\n<p>Even if we agree that software development+version control=good, there are\nstill a lot of complaints about it in the blogpost. For example, the complaint\nthat git is too hard is pretty silly, and the xkcd comic about calling over\ngraph theorist doesn't really help. As a software developer at work, I think\nthat version control simply helps define a disciplined way of working. Version\ncontrol makes you analyze your progress, summarize it as a commit message,\nformat the code properly, make sure it passes tests, and then talk to your\ncollaborators about accepting it. Dropbox might accomplish some of those\nthings, but I would really doubt that it is covering that full scope. Arjun\nseems to agree with using version control for some of his labs software\ndevelopment, so again, there is a spectrum of needs being met. Nevertheless,\nthere are some weird comments about whether commit messages are like a \"lab\nnotebook\", but hint: they are not, write documentation for your project or keep\na separate journal or blog or wiki. Commit messages in my opinion should be\nabout one line, and the changes should be very self explanatory. But another\nbig argument in the blogpost is whether version control works for something\nlike paper writing, and I believe that this underscores something else: that\npaper writing is really a pretty messy procedure.</p>\n<p>I think that perhaps the \"google docs\" mode of writing is probably pretty ok\nfor many things, but it still needs a gatekeeper to incorporate the comments\nfrom coauthors and reviewers into the document in an organized way. In my\nexperience as a \"gatekeeper\" with writing my senior thesis, I organized my\npaper using knitr, and I automated figures being generated by R wherever\npossible, and then I would convert the paper to .docx to share with my\nadvisors. Then I would take their comments on the .docx and incorporate it back\ninto my paper. This could be seen as burdensome (\"why not just use google\ndocs\"), but I felt that it was a good way to incorporate review into a\nreproducible workflow.</p>\n<p>Now, my pipeline precludes your PI from having to learn git to make a pull\nrequest on your paper. That's a good thing... and we still have\nreproducibility. But what about the figures themselves? I said I had knitr for\nreproducible figures, but what about everyone else? I think figures have high\nvalue, and so people might want to have more reproducibility invested in them.\nIn the blog post, it was claimed that making \"complex\" pub-quality figures was\ndifficult (i.e. the plea for Adobe Illustrator), but look at the annotation\nfunctions from ggplot2, and multifaceted images. I found these annotation\nfunctions to be very easy to pick up. There is also the on-going debate about\nggplot2 vs base graphics on the simplystatistics blog, which covers making\npublication quality figures, and last I checked, I think the ggplot2′ers were\nwinning. I don't know how it works in high profile journals like Nature,\nbecause it looks like they just re-do all the figures to make them have some\nconsistent style, but that doesn't mean your original figure should be\nirreproducible.</p>\n<p>The debate about reproducible figures is pretty tangible too in things like\nmicroscopy images. Simply look at the large amount of discussion from pubpeer\nabout image fraud and possible duplications. The pubpeer community obviously\nhas some pretty sophisticated tools for hunting out possibly manipulated\nmicroscopy images. These types of things also lead to investigations, and you\ncan see in the high-profile retraction case over STAP cells that it looks like\nthe investigating committee were simply asking how some figures were made, and\nupon finding that lab members don't know, a paper was retracted. The\nRetractionWatch blog covers these\ninvestigations <a href=\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/26/stap-stem-cell-researcher-obokata-loses-another-paper/\">http://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/26/stap-stem-cell-researcher-obokata-loses-another-paper/</a></p>\n<p>You can't depend on other people to back your figure up, so you need to take\nresponsibility for making sure your papers and your work are reproducible (and,\nthere is a spectrum for reproducibility, but I believe that version control is\na great example of highly disciplined work). I also think that just having\nfolders on some hard drive is not a good way to do things either. There is a\nsaying in software development that is \"if it's not in version control, it\ndoesn't exist\". That's not to say that version control is for everything, big\ndata obviously has trouble with being stored in git. But that shouldn't block\nyou from creating reproducible analyses.</p>\n<p>Another example from the over-reproducibility blogpost says that if you have\n\"analysis1\" and \"analysis2\", then version control advocates would tell you to\ndelete analysis1 and just remember that it is in your history. I think that\nthis is just a different issue. If you actually care about both analyses, just\nmake them separate repositories, with basic README.md files explaining each\nthem, and stop worrying about it. Having one repository containing too many\nmiscellaneous scripts is actually an anti-pattern. Stop making repositories\ncalled \"bioinfo-scripts\" that just contain a mish-mash of analysis scripts!\nMake your work purpose driven and do tasks. Also, this is an argument against\nREPL tools: your R REPL history is not a reproducible script. Make your code\ninto a script that generates well defined outputs. Windows users: you might not\nunderstand this because the command line on windows is crippled, but you have\nto make things run on the command line.</p>\n<p>Now I wish I could say that I live by my words, but having been involved in\ncoauthoring several papers, I will just have to admit that it is really a messy\nprocedure despite my best intentions as an editor and coauthor. I wish things\nwould be better!</p>\n<p>On over-reproducibility: there is no such thing! There are pretty good\narguments to really automate most of a process, especially if it is done\nrepeatedly, to remove human errors, because meat-machines genuinely do things\nwrong all the time.</p>\n<p>And, as my parents would say around the dinner table: \"you can always have\nmore, but you can never have less\"...so, you're not going to get to a point of\nover-reproducibility. We shouldn't cargo cult it as the only way to do science\nbut it's not a bad thing to have.</p>"},{"title":"Cheating in your computer science class by copying from stackoverflow","date":"2015-12-17","slug":"2015-12-17","html":"<p>I would like to tell a story about how I provided some personal tutoring help\nfor a friend in a computer science class, and talk about a nagging feeling that\nreally felt wrong for me.</p>\n<p>So, a long time ago, in a land far far away, a friend took an intermediate\nclass on C++. I was first updated on his progress when he emailed me to get\nsome help with some compiler errors. I was happy to help the young padawan.\nHere was the error:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre>         test.cpp:42:43: error: non-ASCII characters are not allowed outside of literals\n                and identifiers\n              <span class=\"pl-k\">for</span> (startScan = 0<span class=\"pl-k\">;</span> startScan <span class=\"pl-k\">&#x3C;</span> (size − 1)<span class=\"pl-k\">;</span> startScan++)\n                                                    ^~\n</pre></div>\n<p>Now, what does this say to you? For me, it was actually very clear what the\nerror meant. It simply meant that this code was taken from somewhere, and\ncopied and pasted into the compiler. I know that because if they had typed it\nthemself, they definitely would not get this error, because it is the error\nthat implies something was automatically converted to a unicode dash, mostly\nsomething done during copying and pasting. At this point, I just kind of\nlaughed, and helped him fix that. I showed how the compiler is actually pretty\nsmart and can help fix these errors and then I said \"l8r dude\".</p>\n<p>The next week, I had another skype meeting with him, and this time I wanted to\nhelp a little more. It was pretty clear when we started that he was using code\nthat was copied and pasted again. I said, \"uh, ok,....I'm not sure we need that\nnow, but let's just keep going\", and then I sat down and started helping. I\nwanted to help get all the details of the program working, so I helped guide\nthe solution. Each time we needed to test the program, it required repeating\nsome input lines via <code>cin >></code>, which is really annoying (obviously, you should\ntest your code with unit tests, but universities don't teach that, a rant for\nanother day). Anyways, it took awhile, because coding really does just take\ntime, but in the end he finally got it fixed and I said great job, and he\nturned it in!</p>\n<p>Now, on my friends last assignment, I got another call for help, and when we\nstarted skype, I found yet again that he had copied code from somewhere, which\nincluded a C++ class and a main function for doing binary trees. I just simply\nsaid \"dude, delete that, we don't need it\" and so he deleted it, but I think\nmaybe he had worked on this copied code for awhile, and maybe felt it was kind\nof his, so was apprehensive. I insisted though. Then we walked through the\nassignment again, very slowly. I spent probably 2-3 hours helping him out that\nnight. During those hours, I saw him continually making many programming\nmistakes such as just not knowing how to declare variable or a function\nproperly, or just not knowing what to do next. This was kind of frustrating!!!\nBut I wanted to absolutely teach him how to make it right! I was patient\nthough, and I wanted to teach a fun lesson, so I showed how you can do some\n\"unit tests\" which avoids having to constantly re-enter your data via <code>cin >> </code>....</p>\n<p>Now, the padawan completed his C++ class, and then we all were happy ever\nafter....but a disturbance in the force was sensed...</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://zelcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stackoverflow-logo-dumpster.jpg\" alt=\"image\">\nImage from <a href=\"http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/\">http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/</a></p>\n<p>I was reminded about all this due to seeing that <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-on-the-stack-excha\">StackOverflow is now changing\ntheir \"license\" over all the little snippets of\ncode</a>\nthat are posted on their site. It just makes me reflect on literally HOW OFTEN\nPEOPLE JUST COPY AND PASTE FROM THERE. They might understand what they are\ndoing, or they seriously might not!!! I think it is a real problem that people\nsometimes do not understand, but I cannot deny that it can be helpful too.</p>\n<p>If I reflect on education in general, I recall when I took a University level\nphysics class... it was really hard! We had to enter our validated solutions\nfor the math problems into a computerized website homework portal, and that\ninvolved being 100% correct about things. Now, what if there was just a\nphysicsoverflow, where they not only had Q&#x26;A, but they had \"programs\" that gave\nyou all the right answers to your homework problems that you could just copy\nand paste and use as solutions to your homework? This isn't even in the realm\nof asking for \"homework help\" anymore, this is just pure cheating if you can\ncopy your answers from somewhere. It is disappointing though because this is\nwhat people are doing in computer science!! These students are missing out on\nbasic understanding of code. !!thisIsNotOk();</p>\n<p>Now, at least when I was being a tutor for my friend, I felt like my advice\nhelped my friend learn some things, not just give answers. But what if I was\nnot there? I guess there is a certain \"impersonal quality\" that makes asking\nGoogle/StackOverflow for answers less like conventional \"cheating\", but that is\nstill wrong. I think it would be good if more expert knowledge was available\nfor all people, and not just copy and paste snippets. As a start, I thought\nthat <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192385-life-after-moocs/fulltext\">this post by Philip Compeau and Pavel\nPevzner</a>\n(who teach a Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC on Coursera) was very interesting,\nand I really liked their quote:</p>\n<p>\"Online education should move toward replicating the experience of receiving\none-on-one tutoring.\"</p>\n<p>That sounds great, but how can this be acheived? And how can it be done right?\nI think it really requires the student to \"learn how to learn\"</p>\n<p>If I think back to a long time ago, I remember being in 4th or 5th grade and I\ndid a book report on World War 1, and I went to the library. I remember\ndesperately flipping through pages of a 100 page book to try to find some\nsnippets of information to support some basic idea that I wanted to talk about.\nMaybe I wanted to know something specific, but the problem was that I wasn't\nREALLY READING THE BOOK! I probably could have had a better understanding of\nthe topic if I had just read it, or even a part of it, and asked for help, but\ninstead I just picked and chose snippets from the book to \"sound smart\". I am\nvery guilty of this type of error in many instances throughout my school\ncareer, so I am no saint! I even have a phrase to describe this style of\nlearning...I call it \"predatory learning\" and it is probably the worst kind of\nlearning style. Predatory learners often pick and choose from scraps of info,\nbut they never get a full meal!</p>"},{"title":"Killing postgres the hard way","date":"2015-10-22","slug":"2015-10-22","html":"<p>So today, I finally decided to do something about a query that we saw\nhad been running for 25 DAYS on our server</p>\n<p>Note: If you find this post and you need to follow the hard way, backup\nyour data first if possible.</p>\n<p>First I could obviously see the culprit: each postgress query runs it's\nown process so I could see in \"htop\" that there was this process that\nhad been running for 600 hours, or about 25 days</p>\n<p>Next, I opened a psql console and ran this query:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-sql\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">SELECT</span> datname,procpid,current_query <span class=\"pl-k\">FROM</span> pg_stat_activity <span class=\"pl-k\">WHERE</span> datname<span class=\"pl-k\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>database_name<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">ORDER BY</span> procpid ;\n</pre></div>\n<p>This returns which actual queries are being run on the database at any\ngiven time. I could easily see the one problematic query being run,\nwhich was a badly constructed intermine template query that resulted in\na weird \"recursion\" essentially.</p>\n<p>I wanted to try just terminating this query itself, so I ran this</p>\n<pre><code>SELECT pg_cancel_backend(29033);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each time I ran it, it would say it returned one result but it did\nnothing.</p>\n<p>I also read that you can try to nicely \"kill\" it from the command line\n(no kill -9) so I ran</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">></span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">kill</span> 29033\n</pre></div>\n<p>This also did not work!</p>\n<p>I thought perhaps all these problems were because tomcat was still\nactive, so we shut down tomcat, and retried killing the specific query,\nbut to no avail</p>\n<p>At this point, I just wanted to restart the whole database server. Kind\nof a risky move... but I am sort of a risky kind of guy...(that is not a\ngood thing with databases). If you are doing this, make backups! I\ndidn't.

And of course, even though it failed,\nthe database is now unusable. No logging into it anymore, we have to go\nwith the hard way now...</p>\n<p>Looking at /etc/init.d/postgres-9.1 told me that the service stop\ncommand was effectively using something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">></span> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m fast stop\n</pre></div>\n<p>After some reading, I learned that you can try using a slightly\ndifferent flag to restart it</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">></span> pg_ctl -D /db/postgres/data -m immediate  stop\n</pre></div>\n<p>I ran this and to my horror/surprise, it actually worked! At this point\nI decided to start postgresql back up again!</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">></span> service postgresql-9.1 start\n</pre></div>\n<p>The service start quickly returned a SUCCESS, which was great, but then\nI tried to start a psql console and the console froze on me! I could not\neven ctrl+c it!</p>\n<p>I got really worried at this point and I looked at the process manager,\nand saw that there was one postmaster process running but it was not\nclear what it was doing.

Figure 2 shows how high GC activity is\ncorrelated with longer webapp response times, but note that this figure\nwas made after the other memory allocation problems were fixed, so it is\nstill much better than the problems we had in the past.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/131229569383_1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2.

Therefore, using different\ntypes of layouts can really help.</p>\n<p>In my first app with graphviz\n<a href=\"https://colindiesh.shinyapps.io/tumblrgraph\">https://colindiesh.shinyapps.io/tumblrgraph</a>, there are several\nbuilt-in graph layouts including \"neato\" \"twopi\", \"circo\", and \"dot\"</p>\n<p>I made all of these available for users to try in the Shiny app. The\nnames of the layouts don't lend much to their behavior, but they are\nbuilt-in functions in Graphviz. There are both \"tree\" and\n\"force-directed\" style graph views. As I mentioned, the \"tree\" style\nview make a lot of sense for the tumblr reblogs, but the force directed\ngraphs are also a lot more compact, so offering both styles is useful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../media/128000908903_0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1.

The old\ngraphviz app offered animation too (using Yihui's animation library for\nR) but the new version can automatically encode HTML5 video on the\nclient side from individual picture frames in the browser using\n<a href=\"https://github.com/antimatter15/whammy\">\"Whammy\"</a>! This quite\nimpressive!</p>\n<p>So to animate the graph, what is done is</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Add nodes/edges and layout the graph (the simulation time is\nconfigurable, because allowing the user to interact with the graph while\nthe simulation is running is useful)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once layout is complete, the user can save the graph as an\nanimation, which first hides all nodes by adding visibility: hidden to\nthe CSS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then the nodes are re-shown one-by-one, preserving the layout, and a\nframe is saved by the renderer at each step (takes a snapshot of the\ncanvas).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This strategy for the animation is actually better than the original\ngraphviz version that I had because the layout is only done once, which\nis time saving and it is also more consistent (the layout changes a lot\nif you re run it on different sets of nodes).</p>\n<p>Check out the app here <a href=\"http://cmdcolin.github.io/tumblrgraph2/\">http://cmdcolin.github.io/tumblrgraph2/</a></p>\n<p>Future goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test out super large graphs (I have tested up to about 500 reblogs\nbut after this, around 1000 reblogs, it slows down a lot and produces\nbad layouts. Needs fixing)</li>\n<li>Test out ability to place importance on certain nodes by increasing\nnode size based on it's degree</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out an example of the HTML5 video here</p>"},{"title":"Creating high-resolution screenshots (of jbrowse) with phantomJS","date":"2015-03-02","slug":"2015-03-02","html":"<p>Generating screenshots that are of high quality can be a great benefit\nfor things like science publications. PhantomJS is great for automating\nthis in a reproducible way. While many HTML pages can be rendered in\nhigh resolution without modification, HTML5 canvas apps need special\nconsiderations (see this <a href=\"http://searchvoidstar.tumblr.com/post/86542847038/high-dpi-rendering-on-html5-canvas-some-problems\">previous post on the\ntopic</a>).</p>\n<p>One of the key things that we noticed when we developed the high\nresolution canvas rendering (see above link) is that the\n\"devicePixelRatio\" can increase based on the browser's zoom level, and\nit can also take fractional values. This was a difficult problem, to\nmake rendering 100% consistent under all devicePixelRatio values, so we\ncreated a config parameter called highResolutionMode to accept arbitrary\nresolutions.</p>\n<p>Later, we learned about PhantomJS and how it can be used for creating\nscreenshots, it was clear that our design for the settings arbitrary\nscaling factors for the HTML5 canvas was very helpful, as we can set\nhighResolutionMode=4 along with the phantomJS variable\npage.zoomFactor=4, which matches the resolutions and creates high-res\ncanvas screenshots.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons that this is important is that it doesn't look like\nPhantomJS allows \"devicePixelRatio\" to be emulated, so the\npage.zoomFactor doesn't necessarily set the devicePixelRatio to a higher\nnumber, so being able to set the the arbitrary high resolution canvas\nscalings ourselves is a good solution.

I felt that if we were going to keep this going towards canvas,\nthe rendering needed to match the quality of regular HTML based tracks.\nUnfortunately, the HTML5 canvas by default looks very \"fuzzy\" on a high\nresolution display (Figure 1).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/86542847038_0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Figure 1.</em> An example of really bad font rendering before and after enabling\nhigh resolution on the HTML5 canvas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#background\"><a href=\"#background\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Background</h2>\n<p>Major credit goes to the tutorial at\n<a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/hidpi/\">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/hidpi/</a> for pioneering this!\nThe html5rocks tutorial, written in 2010 it still remains relevant. The major\nthing it introduces is these browser variables called devicePixelRatio and\nbackingStoreRatio that can be used to adjust your canvas drawing. In my\ninterpretation, these two variables have the following purpose:</p>\n<p><em>devicePixelRatio</em></p>\n<p>On high DPI displays, screen pixels are actually abstracted away from the\nphysical pixels, so, when you create some HTML element with width 100, height\n100, that element actually takes up a larger number of pixels than 100x100. The\nactual ratio of the pixels that it takes up is 100<em>devicePixelRatio x\n100</em>devicePixelRatio. On a high DPI platform like Retina, the devicePixelRatio\nis normally 2 at 100% zoom.</p>\n<p><em>backingStoreRatio</em></p>\n<p>The backing store ratio doesn't seem to change as much from platform to\nplatform, but my interpretation of this value is that it essentially gives the\nsize of the memory buffer for the canvas. On my platform, the backingStoreRatio\nis \"1\". I think this value had more historical use, but it may not really be\nused anymore (update aug 7th, 2015 deprecated?\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24332639/why-context2d-backingstorepixelratio-deprecated\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24332639/why-context2d-backingstorepixelratio-deprecated</a>)</p>\n<p>So, what are the consequences of the backing store ratio and the device pixel\nratio? If the backing store ratio equals the device pixel ratio, then no\nscaling takes place, but what we often see is that they are not equal, so the\nimage is up-scaled from the backing store to the screen, and then it is\nstretched and blurred.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-how-do-you-enable-the-high-dpi-mode\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#so-how-do-you-enable-the-high-dpi-mode\"><a href=\"#so-how-do-you-enable-the-high-dpi-mode\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>So, how do you enable the high DPI mode?</h2>\n<p>The solution to properly scale your HTML5 canvas content involves a couple of\nsteps that are described in the tutorial here\n<a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/hidpi/\">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/hidpi/</a>, but here is the\nessence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Use the canvas.scale method, which tells the canvas's drawing area to become\nbigger, but keeps drawing operations consistent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The scaling factor for the canvas.scale method is\ndevicePixelRatio/backingStoreRatio. This will be 2 for instance on a Retina\nscreen at a typical 100% zoom level. The zoom level is relevant which will be\ndiscussed later in this post...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiply the width and height attributes of the canvas by\ndevicePixelRatio/backingStoreRatio, so that the \"canvas object\" is as big as\nthe scaled size.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here's the tricky part: set the CSS width and height attributes to be the\nUNSCALED size that you want.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: you can also set CSS width:100% or something and then the canvas will be\nsized appropriately. Normally though, what you will have is something like\n<code>&#x3C;canvas width=640 height=480 style=\"width:320px;height:240px\"></code> so you can see\nthat the canvas size is larger than what the CSS actually resizes it to be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"issues-browser-zoom-and-fractional-devicepixelratios\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#issues-browser-zoom-and-fractional-devicepixelratios\"><a href=\"#issues-browser-zoom-and-fractional-devicepixelratios\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Issues: Browser zoom and fractional devicePixelRatios</h2>\n<p>When I first started this project, the benefit of this high resolution\nrendering seemed limited to the fancy people who had Retina or other High DPI\nscreens. However, what I didn't even realize is that the devicePixelRatio value\nchanges depending on browser zoom settings, so even people with a regular\nscreen can have improved rendering of the HTML5 canvas. (Update: we even saw\nthat if you have customized canvas renderings, then you an generate good\nscreenshots of the canvas with PhantomJS too. See <a href=\"http://searchvoidstar.tumblr.com/post/112494997473/creating-high-resolution-screenshots-of-jbrowse\">my other more recent\narticle</a>)</p>\n<p>The issue with these zoom settings though is that when you change the zoom\nlevel, especially on chrome and firefox browsers, the devicePixelRatio can end\nup being a fractional value e.g. 2.223277 which can result in sub-pixel\nrendering problems.</p>\n<p>Remember that when we scaled the canvas, it also scales the drawing functions\nto be consistent, so that essentially if you draw a 1 pixel width line on a\nscaled canvas, it might draw a 2.223277 pixel width line. Hence, we can get\nfuzzy rendering issues.</p>\n<p>This issue is very noticeable if you draw many 1px wide lines right next to\neach other. In this case, there will be noticeable gaps between the lines due\nto the imperfect rendering (see green box below).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/86542847038_1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Figure 2.</em> Examples of 1px wide lines rendered next to each other when there\nis fractional devicePixelRatio.</p>\n<p>Bottom Green box: 1px wide lines drawn 1px apart.

I'd love to see a proof of\ndetermining this value empirically, or even better, something that isn't this\nbig of a hack, but for now that's what I have.</p>\n<p>You can see the effect of the fudge factor (red box) vs the bad rendering\n(green box) in Figure 2. You can also try this out yourself here\n<a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/4xe4d/\">http://jsfiddle.net/4xe4d/</a>, just zoom your browser and then refresh (zooming\nand not refreshing doesn't modify device pixel ratio) to test out different\nvalues of devicePixelRatio.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\">#</a></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In conclusion...we now have high resolution rendering on canvas! The solution\nfor drawing lots of lines right next to each other is sort of suboptimal, so\nthe question continues...what shall be done in this case?</p>\n<p>Maybe someone could implement some sort of library that replaces the\ncanvas.scale method to do better layout and obtain more pixel perfect\nrendering. Alternatively, you could force the scaling factor to always round to\na whole number. This is actually not a bad solution, because the canvas is\nalready being resized, and then you can control your rendering better.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading</p>"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
