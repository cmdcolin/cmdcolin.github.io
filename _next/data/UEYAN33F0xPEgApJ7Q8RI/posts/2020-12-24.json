Our dearly\ndeparted dixie dog needed a place to have photo uploads.</p>\n<p>I didn't want to get charged dollars per month for a running ec2\ninstance, so I wanted something that was lightweight e.g. serverless,\nand easy</p>\n<p>I decided to follow this tutorial</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/uploading-to-amazon-s3-directly-from-a-web-or-mobile-application/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/uploading-to-amazon-s3-directly-from-a-web-or-mobile-application/</a></p>\n<p>I really liked the command line deployment (aws-sam) because fiddling\naround with the AWS web based control panel is ridiculously complicated</p>\n<p>For example I also tried following this tutorial which uses the web\nbased UI (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw_-0iCVpUc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw_-0iCVpUc</a>) and it just did\nnot work for me....I couldn't stay focused (blame ADHD or just my CLI\nobsession?) and certain things like \"Execution role\" that they say to\nmodify are not there in the web UI anymore, so I just gave up (I did try\nthough!)</p>\n<p>To install aws-sam I used homebrew</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre>brew tap aws/tap\nbrew install aws-sam-cli\nbrew install aws-sam-cli <span class=\"pl-c\"># I had to run the install command twice ref https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/2320#issuecomment-721414971</span>\n\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-s3-presigned-urls-aws-sam\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">cd</span> amazon-s3-presigned-urls-aws-sam\nsam deploy --guided\n\n<span class=\"pl-c\"># proceeeds with a guided installation, I used all defaults except I</span>\n<span class=\"pl-c\"># made \"UploadRequestFunction may not have authorization definedIs</span>\nIs this okay<span class=\"pl-k\">?</span> [y/N]: y<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n</pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"/media/638408397901987840_0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They then in the tutorial describe trying to use postman to test</p>\n<p>I test with <code>curl</code> instead</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-shell\"><pre>curl <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>https://fjgbqj5436.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n\n</pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-json\"><pre>{\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"uploadURL\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>https://sam-app-s3uploadbucket-1653634.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/112162.jpg?Content-Type=image%2Fjpeg&#x26;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&#x26;X-Amz-Credential=xxx&#x26;X-Amz-Date=20201224T174804Z&#x26;X-Amz-Expires=300&#x26;X-Amz-Security-Token=yyy&#x26;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"Key\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>112162.jpg<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n}\n</pre></div>\n<p>The premise of this is you make a request, and then the response from\nthe API is a pre-signed URL that then allows you to upload directly to\nS3. You can use <code>curl &#x3C;url> --upload-file yourfile.jpg</code>. This\nautomatically does a PUT request to the s3 bucket (yes, this is talking\ndirectly to s3 now, not the lambda! the lambda is just for generating\nthe \"pre-signed URL\" to let you upload).
