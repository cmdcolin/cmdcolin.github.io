really a happiness though that I wanted to talk about, it’s just about living
life…sometimes it’s a struggle and that can be rewarding also. So here are
some photos of everyday things</p>

<p>making a drip irrigation system for my weird garden. the sunrise timer was
particularly funny. I put the battery pack in backwards and it didn’t work, and
took it apart to fully understand the mechanism (had to see how the battery
contacts touched the inside of the system to see it)</p>
