scene pretty chaotic</p><p>get the food, drive back home</p><p>eat crab rangoon, eat the rice, eat the lo mein, and finally take a bite
of an eggroll</p><p>dont really realize instantly but know it tastes weird about halfway
through it</p><p>i take 2 benedryl and then start watching youtube for awhile</p><p>the pain in my stomach starts making it hard to focus but throwing up is
also miserable so i just wait</p><p>11pm i instinctively need to vomit</p><p>retching, terrible experience.</p><p>my nose closes up which is sign of airways closing, this often happens
<!-- -->*<!-- -->after<!-- -->*<!-- --> throwing up\</p><p>then i take 2 more benedryl and drink water</p><p>then 10 minutes later i have to throw up again, this time pure water and
benedryll powder coats my whole system which doesn&#x27;t feel as bad but is
still pretty miserable</p><p>take more benedryl, fall asleep in a daze</p><p>i wake up friday still feeling pretty miserable, i did not vomit out
everything probably so it is still messing up my body</p><p>i sleep until like noon and realize i have a work call. i tell ppl i got
a peanut allergy and that i&#x27;m zonked so i skip call.</p><p>i am definitely zonked indeed, its hard to describe my state but it is
like i had a fever and my brain is melted</p><p>i dont understand why an eggroll had peanut in it....google
it....apparently some people add peanut butter to it? weird</p><p>my girlfriend makes me a really nice salad for dinner</p><p>i google about peanut allergy genomics but dont get too far</p><p>i take a shower and sit around in a bathrobe</p><p>on saturday, which is today, i am still headachy and fragile but
hopefully recovering</p><p>\</p><p>random note: i am also allergic to fenugreek, which is closely related
to peanut
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek#Risks_and_side_effects">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek#Risks_and_side_effects</a>) and i
only found this out recently. it explains a lot about mild reactions
that i&#x27;ve gotten to indian foods over the years. I also have sensitivity
to soy protein, lentil, and sometimes chickpea especially like gram
flour</p><p>::: {#footer}
