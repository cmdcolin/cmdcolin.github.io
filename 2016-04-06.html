Homebrew, NPM, gem, cpanm,
gvm/sdkman, etc. these all do amazing things</li><li>Once you learn bash, try zsh and oh-my-zsh, they have things like
case-insensitive tab completion\</li><li>Don&#x27;t make scripts that hardcode paths, make reusable command line
scripts. Use bash as your &quot;REPL&quot;, not R.\</li><li>git log -p helps analyze your log files in full details (make sure
autocoloring is turned on in your terminal)\</li><li>There are keys to jump forward and backwards on the command line
text editor, learn them...don&#x27;t scroll one char at a time\</li><li>Learn how &quot;PATH&quot; works. Generally it is just a set of directories
connected by &quot;:&quot; separators. You can add things to the path by
saying &quot;export PATH=\$PATH:/new/directory/to/add&quot; and you can add
this to <!-- -->~<!-- -->/.bashrc for example\</li><li>When your install process for a command line tool seems like
nonsense, try homebrew instead. barring that, learn PATH, and how to
run &quot;make install&quot;, etc. Most of your headbashing from installing
programs is 90% can be explained by not understanding how the
developer is intending it to be used, 10% of the tool&#x27;s install
process being wrong</li><li>Get a static analyzer and basic tests going on your codebase and run
it on travis-ci. Getting started with travis-ci is kind of a
learning curve, but it is worth it\</li><li>Use cpanm instead of cpan for package management\</li><li>Vocabulary learning curve: catalina is the same thing as tomcat.
CATALINA<!-- -->_<!-- -->HOME is the same thing as the tomcat folder\</li><li>alias ll=&quot;ls -l&quot;, because I type &quot;ll&quot; hundreds of times a day.\</li><li>For irc productivity, run irssi on a server in a &quot;screen&quot;
e.g. &quot;screen irssi&quot; and then you can come back to conversations
later by just logging into the server with ssh\</li><li>Edit <!-- -->~<!-- -->/.ssh/config to include your hostnames so you don&#x27;t have to
type out long ssh
commands <a href="http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/">http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/</a>\</li><li>Use spaces instead of tabs in your source code (<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->:( yes I think
this is the one true way)\</li><li>Try out nodejs and browserify in your spare time to make a &quot;npm&quot;
based app in the browser. it&#x27;s fun.\</li><li>Similarly, try making a simple &quot;api&quot; endpoint on the server side
with express.js or similar. can get started very quickly.</li><li>Learn how to get a mindset of writing tests. You can write tests
proactively (i.e. Test driven development), but you can also write
them &quot;reactively&quot; too (i.e. if have a bug that you fix, you can make
a test to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen anymore)</li><li>Similar to above, tests in this sense are more &quot;sanity checks&quot; than
they are formal proofs. Take &quot;assert&quot; logic and &quot;debugging&quot; code out
of main codebase and put them in tests</li><li>Minimize comments in your code, and also don&#x27;t comment out code and
leave it present. Find a way to delete it and move on!</li><li>When you have a bunch of .orig files after doing a git merge, just
use git clean -f to get rid of them. Similarly, to get rid of
everythng, including things in your gitignore file (i.e. a super
clean) use git clean -fdx. It has a --exclude argument too</li></ul><p>::: {#footer}
