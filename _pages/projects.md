## Work

I have worked on a variety of bioinformatics applications including model
organism databases, genome browsers, and data analysis pipelines. See my
[google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=--FwzsgAAAAJ)
for publications. Our jbrowse 2 paper was
[recently published](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.28.501447v1)
which I was proud to be first author of.

## Small bioinformatics tools

  Visualize the structure of the binning index of BAI files (2023)
- [secondary_rewriter](https://github.com/cmdcolin/secondary_rewriter) - Adds
  SEQ/QUAL tags to secondary alignments in BAM/CRAM, written while learning Rust
  (2022)
- [vcfverifier](https://github.com/cmdcolin/vcfverifier) - Checks that the REF
  field in VCF matches an underlying FASTA reference genome, written while
  learning Rust (2022)
