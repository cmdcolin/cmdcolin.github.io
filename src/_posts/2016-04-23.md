There are a ton of themes for resume-cli that are not immediately obvious to
find

To see all the great themes on the command line, check out

```sh
    curl http://themes.jsonresume.org/themes.json |jq .
```

I tried a bunch of them

```sh
   4679  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-freeland
   4680  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-freelance
   4682  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-with-projects-section
   4683  resume export site/resume/index.html -t dangerflat
   4684  resume export site/resume/index.html -t striking
   4685  resume export site/resume/index.html -t crisp
   4686  resume export site/resume/index.html -t semantic-ui
   4687  resume export site/resume/index.html -t material
   4688  resume export site/resume/index.html -t modern-extended
   4689  resume export site/resume/index.html -t paper
   4690  resume export site/resume/index.html -t smart
   4691  resume export site/resume/index.html -t flat

```

Note: resume.json is setup to use HTML themes, so even though it has a PDF
output option, it is inherently converting HTML first and then to PDF. The PDF
conversion is done by a automated cloud service, which currently can fail
sometimes. It is probably better to just choose HTML and convert to PDF if you
need to. See https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli/issues/94
