title: Making a pure-ESM package using `tsc`

In the past, I have written about making NPM packages with just the typescript
compiler (https://cmdcolin.github.io/posts/2022-05-27-youmaynotneedabundler).
There, I focused on "CJS" build because it was arguably simpler

Now, I am addressing the "ESM" case

TLDR: here is the minimal github repo for this post
https://github.com/cmdcolin/minimalpackage

## Why pure-ESM now?

As my previous article mentions, I like taking a 'bundler-less' approach to
library distribution. That means that multiple files might end up in the `dist`
folder which reference each other. However, using "pure ESM" requires these
files that reference each other to import the actual path, with the file
extensions

Which was awkward before...but now

## We have some new tsconfig.json settings to help

The recent addition of the `tsc` settings
[`allowImportingTsExtensions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/allowImportingTsExtensions.html)
and
[`rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-7/#path-rewriting-for-relative-paths)
have now allow us to import from the .ts file extension in the src folder, and
it automatically rewrites to use the .js file extension in the dist folder

For example we can have

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import { bar } from './bar.ts'
export function foo() {
  bar()
}
```

```typescript
// src/bar.ts
export function bar() {
  console.log('bar in bar.ts')
}
```

then running tsc over these files will produce

```
 ❯❯❯ ll dist
total 24K
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cdiesh cdiesh  37 Jan 14 06:07 bar.d.ts
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cdiesh cdiesh  91 Jan 14 06:07 bar.js
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cdiesh cdiesh  43 Jan 14 06:07 index.d.ts
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cdiesh cdiesh 116 Jan 14 06:07 index.js

```

where dist/index.js now contains an import with the .js extension

```javascript
import { foo } from './bar.js'
foo()
```

and dist/bar.js says

```javascript
import { bar } from './bar.js'
export function foo() {
  bar()
}
```

Previously you had to write `import {foo} from './bar.js'` in the src folder to
have this behavior, but now you can reference the actual file, bar.ts

## The package.json

```json
{
  "name": "minimalpackage",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "simple pure-esm package compatible with tsc",
  "license": "MIT",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": "./dist/index.js",
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "clean": "rimraf dist",
    "prebuild": "yarn clean",
    "preversion": "yarn build",
    "postversion": "git push --follow-tags"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "rimraf": "^6.0.1",
    "typescript": "^5.7.3"
  }
}
```

Some things you can observe

- I specify main and exports. Exports is sufficient for some but requires
  consumers use moduleResolution with nodenext which is rare

- You can see from the above, I did not need to specify the location of "types"

- Lots of usages of "exports" have a complex object but it can simply be a
  string that points to a file

- I use rimraf to clear the dist folder before building. I can use "yarn build
  --watch" for a tsc watcher

- You can run `yarn publish` to publish to NPM, and it will automatically run
  the clean and build via the preversion script, and then will automatically
  push the updated version and tag to github once it is finished via the
  postversion script

## The tsconfig.json

```json
{
  "include": ["src"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "target": "es2020",
    "declaration": true,
    "strict": true,
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true
  }
}
```

## Using minimalpackage

```typescript
import { foo } from 'minimalpackage'
foo()
```

## Conclusion

This article proposes a bundler-less approach to distributing typescript
packages on NPM. It was possible before, but I think the addition of the
`allowImportingTsExtensions` and `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` made it more
sane.

## Footnote 1 - Publishing dual ESM/CJS using this technique

I don't even know if I fully stand behind doing a dual publish this way, but for
reference, here is a potential way to dual ESM/CJS publish with this method
https://gist.github.com/cmdcolin/c3089a4b37f2ff8c8eabce5ebd3b4082

The 'quick start kit' tshy is also a pretty good minimal approach to publishing.
You might consider trying it

## Footnote 2 - Add the eslint-plugin-import with rule requiring file extension imports

Add this to your eslint config

```
'import/extensions': ['error', 'ignorePackages'],
```

It will enforce importing from specific files, except for package names e.g. you
need to import from 'yourfile.ts' for your code, but can import from packages
like normal like `import {useState} from 'react'`
