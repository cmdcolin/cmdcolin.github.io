Many of these issues may be due to me being stubborn with a weird build system.
Nonetheless, they were baffling, and I had very little interest in debugging
these issues. I just wanted to get my science done after all!

# Module load completely barfs with incomprehensible error

```sh
    $ module spider bedtools
    Using system spider cache file
    /opt/software/lmod/bin/lua: /opt/software/lmod/4.1.4icer5/libexec/Spider.lua:662: attempt to perform arithmetic on a nil value
    stack traceback:

# Linuxbrew is terribly confused by things that depend on gcc

```sh
    brew install hello
    ==> Installing dependencies for hello: glibc, xz, gmp, mpfr, libmpc, isl, gcc
    ==> Installing hello dependency: glibc
    Error: glibc cannot be built with any available compilers.
    Install Clang or brew install gcc
```

Using module load Clang does not fix problem \>\_\<

# Compiling things manually on software machine does not work on interactive machine

```sh
    $ mummer
    Illegal instruction (core dumped)

# Many modules have a secret dependency on loading other modules

    $ module load LASTZ

    Lmod Warning: Did not find: LASTZ

    Try: "module spider LASTZ"
    $ module load GNU
    $ module load LASTZ
    $ lastz
    You must specify a target file
    lastz-- Local Alignment Search Tool, blastZ-like
      (version 1.03.02 released 20110719)
    ...
```

Etc etc.
