to do an &quot;experiment&quot; and try to do everything without PowerPoint.</p><p>Crazy you say? Well, I considered some options, and I went ahead and
made my presentation using
<a href="http://ramnathv.github.io/slidify/customize.html">Slidify</a>!!</p><p>I was super impressed with Slidify because it was very easy to get
started and it uses R Markdown syntax which I have already used for some
blog posts. To get started, you just use a textfile and separate the
slides using a newline with three dashes &quot;---&quot;. After just a few
minutes, you can easily start generating HTML output slideshows that
work great.</p><p>It helps if you have some web design experience to use Slidify also,
because you can style Markdown code using CSS. Here is a discussion
about how to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/255170/markdown-and-image-alignment">align images in a markdown document, and I particularly
like the second
answer</a>.
Unfortunately. I had some trouble aligning images too, so I think I
could probably do with some practice (see Figure 1)</p><p><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/fd0a1bbcb464afa24393fe7442906eda/311221fe66cef2f3-45/s540x810/ba83892db13b3c1a8075663407d9b9ae47647986.jpg"/></p><p>Figure 1. Example slide from my presentation with a figure that is
cutoff. I used the CSS style &quot;float:right&quot; but for some reason it didn&#x27;t
stay on the page.</p><p>I also wanted to publish my slides on the web, and found that you can
use Slidify to publish to your Github repository using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github
Pages.</a> Again, this process was also
surprisingly simple: you simply make a branch on your repository that is
named &quot;gh-pages&quot; and push all your Slidify slides to it!</p><p>The outcome: <a href="http://tonto.github.io/macs-accessories/slides.html#1">Comparison and analysis of ChIP-seq
experiments</a></p><p>Feel free to check out the slides, and you can also see the code for
generating the slides on my <a href="https://github.com/tonto/macs-accessories/tree/gh-pages">Github
Branch</a>. Soon,
I may also update the code for the slides to generate the figures
instead of just linking to figures</p><p>::: {#footer}
