This allowed (a) a significant\nreduction in data fetches because I implemented a\\xA0\"read redispatcher\" that\nwould actually literally resolve the read pairs in the separate chunks and\n(b) a cleaner view because the layout wouldn't be polluted by very long read\ninserts all the time and also, for example, if you scrolled to the right, and\nsuddenly a read was paired to the left side of your view, it would result in\na bad layout (but with max insert size, the window of all reads within\nmaxinsertsize are always resolved so this does not happen) and finally ( c)\nthe paired arc view was incorporated which does not use read redispatching\nand which can do very long reads. All of these things took time to think\nthrough and resolve, but it is now I think a pretty solid system and I look\nforward to user feedback!`))))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n","scope":{}}},{"title":"Problems that I experienced with the HPCC","date":"2017-04-21","slug":"2017-04-21","mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"var p=Object.defineProperty,m=Object.defineProperties;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var r=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,a=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var c=(e,o,t)=\u003eo in e?p(e,o,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:t}):e[o]=t,n=(e,o)=\u003e{for(var t in o||(o={}))r.call(o,t)\u0026\u0026c(e,t,o[t]);if(i)for(var t of i(o))a.call(o,t)\u0026\u0026c(e,t,o[t]);return e},d=(e,o)=\u003em(e,u(o));var s=(e,o)=\u003e{var t={};for(var l in e)r.call(e,l)\u0026\u0026o.indexOf(l)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(t[l]=e[l]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026i)for(var l of i(e))o.indexOf(l)\u003c0\u0026\u0026a.call(e,l)\u0026\u0026(t[l]=e[l]);return t};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(t){var l=t,{components:e}=l,o=s(l,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,d(n(n({},layoutProps),o),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,`Many of these issues may be due to me being stubborn with a weird build system.\nNonetheless, they were baffling, and I had very little interest in debugging\nthese issues.

Arjun seems to agree with using\nversion control for some of his labs software development, so again,\nthere is a spectrum of needs being met. Nevertheless, there are some\nweird comments about whether commit messages are like a \"lab notebook\",\nbut hint: they are not, write documentation for your project or keep a\nseparate journal or blog or wiki. Commit messages in my opinion should\nbe about one line, and the changes should be very self explanatory. But\nanother big argument in the blogpost is whether version control\\xA0works\nfor something like paper writing, and I believe that this underscores\nsomething else: that paper writing is really a pretty messy procedure.`),mdx(\"p\",null,`I think that perhaps the\\xA0\"google docs\" mode of writing is probably\npretty ok for many things, but it still needs a gatekeeper to\nincorporate the comments from coauthors and reviewers into the document\nin an organized way. In my experience as a \"gatekeeper\"\\xA0with writing my\nsenior thesis, I organized my paper using knitr, and I automated figures\nbeing generated by R wherever possible, and then I would convert the\npaper to .docx to share with my advisors. Then I would take their\ncomments on the .docx and incorporate it back into my paper. This could\nbe seen as burdensome (\"why not just use google docs\"), but I felt that\nit was a good way to incorporate review into a reproducible workflow.`),mdx(\"p\",null,`Now, my pipeline precludes your PI from having to learn git to make a\npull request on your paper. That's a good thing... and we still have\nreproducibility.\\xA0\\xA0But what about the figures themselves? I said I had\nknitr for reproducible figures, but what about everyone else? I think\nfigures have high value, and so people might want to have more\nreproducibility invested in them. In the blog post, it was claimed that\nmaking \"complex\" pub-quality figures was difficult\\xA0(i.e. the plea for\nAdobe Illustrator), but look at the annotation functions from ggplot2,\nand multifaceted images. I found these annotation functions to be very\neasy to pick up. There is also the on-going debate about ggplot2 vs base\ngraphics on the simplystatistics blog, which covers making publication\nquality figures, and last I checked, I think the ggplot2\\u2032ers were\nwinning.

These types of things also lead\nto investigations, and you can see in the high-profile retraction case\nover STAP cells that it looks like the investigating committee were\nsimply asking how some figures were made, and upon finding that lab\nmembers don't know, a paper was retracted.

I also think that just having folders on some hard drive is not a\ngood way to do things either. There is a saying in software development\nthat is\\xA0\"if it's not in version control, it doesn't exist\".

I think that this is just a different issue. If you actually\ncare about both analyses, just make them separate repositories, with\nbasic README.md files explaining each them, and stop worrying about it.\nHaving one repository containing too many miscellaneous scripts is\nactually an anti-pattern. Stop making repositories\ncalled\\xA0\"bioinfo-scripts\" that just contain a mish-mash of analysis\nscripts! Make your work purpose driven and do tasks.
