Strogatz. Here is a quick introduction to differential equations that I
tried to start up with and an example from the book</p><p>The chapter 1 of Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos talks about the lay of the
land in chaos theory and starts to give a couple of examples with
differential equations. But what is a differential equation?</p><p>Well, it can be basically any calculus system where you have a
relationship between rates of change of a variable and other things.
That is very vague, but maybe for example, we can look at the
acceleration of an object undergoing friction as an ODE and observe that
the acceleration of the object is actually related to how fast it is
already going, so the second derivative is related to the first
derivative itself.</p><p>The initial example in the book refers to something like an object on a
spring that is experiencing friction, a &quot;damped oscillator&quot;.</p><p><img src="../../media/158949147558_0.png"/></p><p>To try to study this system, we transformed it into two equations by
introducing a variable substitution</p><p><img src="../../media/158949147558_1.png"/></p><p>In this system, x1 is the position, and the derivative of x1 is velocity
(change in position over time), and we define derivative of x1 as x2.
Then acceleration, the derivative of x2, is given by it&#x27;s relationship
to the constants (k is spring constant, lookup spring on wiki for
explanation just like hardness of spring, b is damping force or
friction, m is mass) and x1 and x2</p><p>We can then code this system of equations in R, in this new system:</p><pre><code>    library(deSolve)
    # x1 = initial position
    # x2 = initial velocity
    state &lt;- c(x1 = 100, x2 = 0)
    # b = damping constant (e.g. friction)
    # m = mass
    # k = spring constant for oscillator
    parameters &lt;- c(b = 10, m = 50, k = 100)
    DampedOscillator&lt;-function(t, state, parameters) {
      with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
        dX &lt;- x2
        dY &lt;- -b/m*x2-k/m*x1
        list(c(dX, dY))
      })
    }
    # go from time 0 to 100, iterating by 0.01 seconds
    times &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 0.01)
    # run simulation for each timestep
    out &lt;- ode(y = state, times = times, func = DampedOscillator, parms = parameters)
    # plot multiple plots on one plot, not too important
    x=par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    # plot of position over time
    plot(out[,&#x27;time&#x27;], out[,&#x27;x1&#x27;], type=&#x27;l&#x27;, xlab=&#x27;time&#x27;, ylab=&#x27;position&#x27;)
    # plot of variable over time
    plot(out[,&#x27;time&#x27;], out[,&#x27;x2&#x27;], type=&#x27;l&#x27;, xlab=&#x27;time&#x27;, ylab=&#x27;velocity&#x27;)
    # phase plot
    plot(out[,&#x27;x1&#x27;], out[,&#x27;x2&#x27;], type=&#x27;l&#x27;, xlab=&#x27;position&#x27;, ylab=&#x27;velocity&#x27;)
    # restore plots
    par(x)
</code></pre><p>Now run this in R and see what the output is. For me it looks like this:</p><p><img src="../../media/158949147558_2.png"/></p><p>Does this plot make sense for an &quot;oscillating object undergoing
friction&quot;? Does the code make sense? Any questions about how this is
setup?</p><p>Now try playing with the system</p><p>Exercise 1: Try changing initial position <code>x1</code> to be 0 and initial
velocity <code>x2</code> to 100, and run the simulation again. Do the results make
sense?</p><p>Exercise 2: Try changing the parameters such as increasing the friction
<code>b</code> to a high value, what happens?</p><p>Exercise 3: Try making <code>b</code> equal to 0, what happens?</p><p>This system of equations does not demonstrate chaos, but next time we
can try and look at a chaotic system!</p><p>::: {#footer}
