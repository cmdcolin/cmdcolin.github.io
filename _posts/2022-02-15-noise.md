Found this photo of myself from a photo book published by john cates called
auditory depravation...great documentation of michigan area noise activity. I
am actually the last photo in the book amongst so many amazing
artists...totally honored. I forgot I was even in the book when I picked it up
randomly.

thank you john cates!!!
