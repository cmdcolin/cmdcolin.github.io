I recently moved and found this photo of myself from a photo book published by john cates called auditory depravation.

I don't at all deserve to be in the zine, but I am actually the last photo in
the book amongst so many amazing artists

totally honored. I forgot I was even in the book but such an good collection of photos

love the bleak concrete expanse, with the silly synth based noise that I do
often to no audience
