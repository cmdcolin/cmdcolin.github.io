  Structural variants and the SAM format - the long (reads) and short (reads) of
  it

The `SAM` specification is pretty amazing
(https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) but it is also fairly terse and
abstract. True understanding might come from playing with real world data. I
will try to relay some things I have learned over the years, with a bit of a
focus on how `SAM` file concepts can relate to structural variants.

Disclaimer: I'm a developer of JBrowse 2. This document has some screenshots and
links for it, feel free to try it at https://jbrowse.org.

## Basics

### What is a `SAM` file and how does it relate to `BAM` and `CRAM`?

- A `SAM` file **generally** contains "reads" from a sequencer, with information
  about how they are mapped to a reference genome [1][2].

- A `SAM` file is **generally** produced when an aligner takes in raw unaligned
  reads (often stored in `FASTQ` format files) and aligns them to a reference
  genome [3].

- A `SAM` file is a text format that you can read with your text editor. `BAM`
  and `CRAM` are compressed representations of the `SAM` format.

You can convert `SAM` to `BAM` with samtools

```sh
samtools view file.sam -o file.bam
```

You can also convert a `BAM` back to `SAM` with samtools view

```sh
samtools view -h file.bam -o file.sam
```

The -h just makes sure to preserve the header.

If you are converting `SAM` to `CRAM`, it may require the -T argument to specify
your reference sequence (this is because the `CRAM` is "reference compressed")

```sh
samtools view -T reference.fa file.sam -o file.cram
```

Also see Appendix C: piping FASTQ from `minimap2` directly to CRAM

[1] `SAM` can contain any type of sequence, not specifically reads. If you
created a _de novo_ assembly, you could align the contigs of the _de novo_
assembly to a reference genome and store the results in `SAM`.

[2] Does not always have to have information about mapping to a reference
genome. You can also store unaligned data in `SAM`/`BAM`/`CRAM` (so-called
`uBAM` for example) but most of the time, the reads in `SAM` format are aligned
to a reference genome.

[3] Examples of programs that do alignment include `bwa`, `bowtie`, and
`minimap2` (there are many others). These programs all can produce `SAM` outputs

### What is in a `SAM` file

A `SAM` file contains a header (`BAM` and `CRAM` files also have the `SAM`
header) and a series of records. A record is a single line in a `SAM` file, and
it generally corresponds to a single read, but as we will see, a split alignment
may produce multiple records that refer to the same source read.

Note: if a read failed to align to the reference genome, it may still be in your
`SAM` file, marked as unmapped using the flag column. Sometimes, "dumpster
diving" (looking at the unmapped records from a `SAM` file) can be used to aid
structural variant searches (e.g. there may be novel sequence in there not from
the reference genome that could be assembled)

### What are tags in a `SAM` file

A SAM file has a core set of required fields, and then an arbitrary list of
extra columns called tags. The tags have a two character abbreviation like `MQ`
(mapping quality) or many others. They can be upper or lower case. Upper case
are reserved for official usages (except those with X, Y, or Z prefixed). See
[SAMtags.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf) for more details

### What is a `CIGAR` string

A `CIGAR` string is a "compact idiosyncratic gapped alignment report". It tells
you about insertions, deletions, and clipping. It is a series of "operators"
with lengths.

Insertion example:

`50M50I50M`

That would be 50bp of matching bases (`50M`), followed by a 50bp insertion
(`50I`), followed by another 50bp of matches (`50M`). The 50bp insertion means
the read contains 50 bases in the middle which did not match the reference
genome that you are comparing the read to.

Clipping example:

`50S50M50S`

This means that 50bp matched (`50M` in the middle of the `CIGAR` string) and
both sides of the read are soft clipped. The clipping means the aligner was not
able to align the reads on either side.

Notes:

- _Finding mismatches_: A `CIGAR` string match like `50M` means 50 bases
  "matched" the reference genome, but that only means that there are no
  insertions or deletions in those 50 bases. There could be underlying
  mismatches in the read compared to the reference. Note: there is also extended
  `CIGAR` that replaces `M` with `=` (exact match) and `X` (mismatch). Also see
  Appendix D on the `MD` tag and finding where the mismatches are, but note that
  `MD` tag is tricky

- _Ambiguity of representation_: A `CIGAR` string with insertions and deletions
  could be `50M1D1I50M`. This string had a 1bp deletion and a 1bp insertion
  back-to-back. This could be just a mismatch! There is ambiguity in sequence
  alignment representations. Downstream programs must accommodate this.

- _Split records and soft-clipping_: A `CIGAR` string with soft-clipping
  `500S50M` this means that 500 bases of the read were not aligned at this
  position, but 50 bases were! Note that the alignment might have been a split
  alignment (see section on split alignments below) so another record in the
  `SAM` file, linked by the `SA` (supplementary alignment) tag, might contain
  info on where the other 500 bases aligned! (or, they might not map anywhere).
  The linked split or supplementary alignments all have the same read name
  (`QNAME`).

See [SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) for all the
CIGAR operators.

If you are working with `SAM` data, you will often write loops that directly
parse CIGAR strings. See Appendix B for handy functions for parsing `CIGAR`
strings. Don't fear the `CIGAR`!

## Detecting SVs from long reads

Long reads offer a wide array of methods for detecting SVs

- _Small insertions/deletions_: Long reads can completely span moderate sized
  insertions and deletions, indicated by `I` or `D` in a `CIGAR` string.
- _Large insertions/deletions_: If a long read does not completely span an
  insertion or deletion, it may be split aligned on either side of the SV or
  could be soft/hard clipped where it can't align all the way through an
  insertion.
- _Translocations_: A split long alignment can span long range or even
  inter-chromosomal translocations, so part of the read maps to one chromosome
  and one part maps to the other
- _Inversions_: A split alignment can span an inversion, the long read is split
  into multiple parts, one part of it aligns in the reverse orientation, while
  the other part aligns in the forward orientation

Note that there are many different methods for detecting SVs from long reads,
e.g. not all use mapped reads from SAM files, some use _de novo_ assembly, but
it is still useful to be familiar with mapped read methods.

### What are split/supplementary/chimeric alignments?

Split alignments, or chimeric alignments, are alignments where part of the read
maps to one place, and another part to another. For example, part of a long read
may map to `chr1` and part of it maps to `chr4`. It is worth reading the
definition of "Chimeric alignment" from
[SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) when you get the
chance.

As [SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) tells us, one
record is marked as "representative", sometimes also called the "primary"
record, while the other components of the split read are marked "supplementary",
given the 2048 flag. The "primary" record generally has a `SEQ` field that
represents the entirety of the original read's sequence (with CIGAR soft
clipping operators saying which part of that sequence aligned), and the
"supplementary alignments" will have `SEQ` field but sometimes just segments of
the original read's sequence with CIGAR hard clipping operators indicating that
it is partial.

Supplementary alignments are especially common with long reads, and it can be a
signal for structural variants e.g. where two chromosomes are fused together,
and parts of the read align to multiple chromosomes, or the split alignment may
align to either side of a large deletion, or they may be split to align through
an inversion (part of it aligns to the forward strand, part of it to the reverse
strand, and again the forward strand)

There is no limitation on how many splits might occur so the split can align to
3, 4, or more different places. Each part of the split puts a new line in the
SAM file, and note that all the records also have the same read name, or `QNAME`
(first column of `SAM`).

### What are secondary alignments/multi-mappers

Secondary alignments generally come from "multi-mappers" where the entire read
maps equally well (or at least somewhat equally well) to, say, somewhere on both
`chr4` and `chr1`. "Multi mapping" results in secondary alignments, while split
reads result in supplementary alignments. See "Multiple mapping" in the
[SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) for the definition
of multi-mapping. Note also that secondary alignments sometimes are missing the
`SEQ` field entirely too, see
https://github.com/lh3/minimap2/issues/458#issuecomment-516661855

I wrote a tool called secondary_rewriter to add the `SEQ` field back to
secondary alignments, which may help in some cases

### What is the `SA` tag?

The `SA` tag is outputted on each part of the supplementary/split/chimeric
alignment, e.g. the primary contains an `SA` tag that refers to information
(e.g. the location) of where all the supplementary alignments where placed, and
each of the supplementary alignments also contains an `SA` tag that refers to
the primary alignment and each other supplementary alignment.

Fun fact: The `SA` tag conceptually can result in a 'quadratic explosion' of
data, because each part of the split contains references to every other part.
For example, if a read is split into 4 pieces, then each record would would have
an `SA` tag with 3 segments, so 3\*4 segments will be documented in the `SA`
tag. In many cases, this is not a problem, but if you imagine a finished
chromosome aligned to a draft assembly, it may get split so many times this
could be a factor.

See [SAMtags.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf) for more
info on the `SA` tag.

### Visualizing split reads across a breakend or translocation

This is a specialized JBrowse 2 feature, but if there is an inter-chromosomal
translocation, you can load this into JBrowse and visualize support for this
event using our "breakpoint split view". This view shows the evidence for the
reads that are split aligned across an SV, and can show connections between
paired-end reads across an SV too.

We also have a workflow called the "SV inspector" that helps you setup the
"breakpoint split views" (https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/user_guide/#sv-inspector.
The SV inspector and Breakpoint split view work best on Breakends (e.g. VCF 4.3
section 5.4) and `<TRA>` (translocation) events from `VCF`, or `BEDPE` formatted
SV calls, and you can launch the "breakpoint split view" from the "SV inspector"

![](/media/breakpoint_split_view.png)

### Visualizing a 'read vs reference' view given a split alignment

If we are given the the primary alignment of an arbitrary split read, then we
can construct what that split looks like compared to the reference genome.

If we are not given the primary alignment (e.g. we are starting from a
supplementary alignment) then we can search the `SA` list for the one that is
primary, because at least one will be.

Now that we have the primary alignment, it will have the `SEQ` (of the entire
read, the supplementary alignments typically have a blank `SEQ`!) and the `SA`
tag containing the `CIGAR` of all the different parts of the split. We can then
construct how the entire read, not just a particular record of the split
alignment, compares to the genome. In JBrowse 2 we implemented this and it uses
a synteny-style rendering. [1]

![](/media/linear_alignment.png)

Figure showing JBrowse 2 piecing together a long read vs the reference genome
from a single read

In order to do this reconstruction, JBrowse 2 takes the `CIGAR` strings of the
primary alignment and each of the pieces of the `SA` tag (it is a semi-colon
separated list of chunks), sort them by the amount of softclipping (the
softclipping values will progressively trim off more of the `SEQ` telling you it
aligned further and further on in the long read), and then this tells me where
each piece of the split alignment came from in the original `SEQ`, so we can
plot the alignments of the read vs the reference genome using synteny style
display.

[1] Similar functionality also exists in GenomeRibbon https://genomeribbon.org

### `SAM` vs `VCF` - Breakends vs split alignments

An interesting outcome (to me) is that from a single record in a `SAM` file, I
can reconstruct the "derived" genome around a region of interest from a single
read.

If I was to try to do this with the `VCF` Breakend specification (section 5.4 of
[VCF4.3.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf)), it may actually
be more challenging than from a `SAM` read. This is because a Breakend in `VCF`
format is only an edge in a graph (and the sequences are nodes). Therefore, in
order to properly reconstruct a structural variant from a `VCF` with Breakends,
I would have to construct a graph and decode paths through it.

I like the ability to reconstruct the derived genome from a single read, but
individual reads can be noisy (contain errors). That said, _de novo_ assembled
contigs can also be stored in `SAM` format and is significantly less noisy
(being composed of the aggregate information of many reads).

The point though is that interpretation of the `VCF` breakend specification is
challenging due to imposing a sequence graph on the genome, while the `SA` tag
remains just a simple set of linear alignments that can easily be pieced
together, and you only need to refer to a single record in the `SAM` file to do
so.

I am not aware of a lot of tools that work on the `VCF` Breakend graph, and
expect more will need to be created to truly work with this standard. An
inversion for example may create 4 record in the `VCF` file (see section 5.4 in
the [VCF4.3.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf) for example),
and needs careful interpretation.

### Haplotype tagged reads

A new trend has been to create `SAM`/`BAM`/`CRAM` files with tagged reads, which
tells us which haplotype a read was inferred to have come from. This is commonly
done with the `HP` tag, which might have `HP=0` and `HP=1` for a diploid genome.
Tools like `whatshap` can add these tags to a `SAM` file, and IGV and JBrowse 2
can color and sort by these tags.

![](/media/color_by_tag.png)

Screenshot of JBrowse 2 with the "Color by tag" and "Sort by tag" setting
enabled (coloring and sorting by the `HP` tag) letting us see that only one
haplotype has a deletion. Tutorial for how to do this in JBrowse 2 here
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/user_guide/#sort-color-and-filter-by-tag

## How do you detect SVs with paired-end reads?

### Distance between pairs being abnormally large or short

The distance between pairs is encoded by the `TLEN` column in the `SAM` format.
The distance between pairs with good mapping is relatively constant and called
the "insert length". This comes from how the sequencing is done: paired-end
sequencing performs sequencing on both ends of a fragment.

But, if you are mapping reads vs the reference genome, and you observe that they
are abnormally far apart, say 50kb apart instead of 1kb apart, this may indicate
there your sample contains a deletion relative to the reference.

![](/media/aberrant_size.png)

Screenshot of JBrowse 1 with "View as pairs" enabled with "mate paired"
sequencing, and large insert size colored as red (from
https://jbrowse.org/docs/paired_reads.html. Note that some of JBrowse 1's View
as pairs features are not yet available in JBrowse 2

### Mate pairs vs paired end reads

"Mate paired" reads have a larger distance between pairs (aka the insert size is
larger). Think: mate pairs have 2-5kb between pairs instead of a couple hundred
bp. Mate pairs can be useful in scaffolding de novo genome assemblies since the
larger range can span gaps, giving evidence that multiple contigs are connected.

"Paired-end" reads typically have like 200-500bp distance between pairs (aka,
the insert size).

Data sheet
https://web.archive.org/web/20210827021305/https://www.illumina.com/Documents/products/datasheets/datasheet_genomic_sequence.pdf

The above JBrowse screenshot shows mate pairs. Note that mate pairs have a
different pair orientation, and pairs don't necessarily point at each other,
they "point away from each other" in normal conditions due. See Appendix A for
more info.

### Linked reads aka simulated long reads

Linked reads are another method that uses short reads but gives long read
information. I don't have a lot of info on this but will update this section if
I do. The company, 10x genomics, that originally used this discontinued
commercial sequencing using this method to focus instead on single cell AFAIK.
https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/linked-reads

### An abundance of reads being "clipped" at a particular position

This can indicate that part of the reads map well, but then there was an abrupt
stop to the mapping. This might mean that there is a sequence that was an
insertion at that position, or a deletion, or a translocation.

The clipping is indicated by the `CIGAR` string, either at the start or end of
it by an `S` or an `H`. The `S` indicates "soft clipping", and indicates that
the sequence of the clipped portion can be found in the `SEQ` field of the
primary alignment. The `H` is hard clipped, and the sequence that is hard
clipped will not appear in the `SEQ`.

![](/media/clipping_pileup.png)

Screenshot of JBrowse 2 showing blue clipping indicator with a "pileup" of
soft-clipping at a particular position shown in blue. The clipping is an
"interbase" operation (it occurs between base pair coordinates) so it is plotted
separately from the normal coverage histogram.

![](/media/show_soft_clipping.png)

Screenshot of JBrowse 2 showing an insertion with Nanopore (top), PacBio
(middle) and Illumina short reads. The long reads may completely span the
insertion, so the `CIGAR` string on those have an `I` operator and are indicated
by the purple triangle above the reads. For the short reads, the reads near the
insertion will be clipped since they will not properly map to the reference
genome and cannot span the sinsertion. The "Show soft clipping" setting in
JBrowse 2 and IGV can be used to show visually the bases that extend into the
insertion (shown on the bottom track).

### Unexpected pair orientation

With standard paired end sequencing, the pairs normally point at each other

```
forward reverse
 --->    <---
```

If the stranded-ness of the pair is off, then it could indicate a structural
variant. See Appendix A for a handy function for calculating pair orientation.

This guide from IGV is helpful for interpreting the pair directionality with
patterns of SVs using "Color by pair orientation"

https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/interpreting_pair_orientations

![](/media/inverted_duplication.png)

Figure: JBrowse 2 showing an inverted (tandem) duplication in 1000 genomes data.
It uses the same coloring as IGV for pair orientation. The tandem duplication
can produce green arrows which have reads pointing in opposite directions e.g.
`<--` and `-->`, while blue arrows which can indicate an inversion point in the
same direction e.g. `-->` and `-->`

### Caveat about TLEN

Note that `TLEN` is a field in the SAM format that is somewhat ill defined, at
least in the sense that different tools may use it differently
https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam/issues/667#issuecomment-381521767

If needed, you can calculate `TLEN` yourself if you process the file yourself
(e.g. process all reads, get the actual records for the pairs, and calculate
distance) but I have not had trouble with relying on the `TLEN` from the data
files themselves.

## Calling copy number variants with your short or long reads

Another type of SV that you can get from your `SAM` files are copy number
variants (CNVs). By looking at the depth-of-coverage for your data files, you
can look for abnormalities that may indicate copy number variants. By using a
tool like `mosdepth`, you can quickly get a file showing the coverage across the
genome.

Be aware that if you are comparing the coverage counts from different tools,
that they have different defaults that may affect comparison. Some discard
`QC_FAIL`, `DUP`, and `SECONDARY` flagged reads. This is probably appropriate,
and corresponds to what most genome browsers will display (see
https://gist.github.com/cmdcolin/9f677eca28448d8a7c5d6e9917fc56af for a short
summary of depth calculated from different tools)

Note that both long and short reads can be used for CNV detection. Long reads
may give more accurate measurements also, with their better ability to map
smoothly through difficult regions of the genome.

`BigWig`, and loaded into JBrowse 2. See

and
[tutorial](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/user_guide/#viewing-whole-genome-coverage-for-profiling-cnv))

## The future, with graph genomes and _de novo_ assemblies

Currently, SV visualization is highly based on comparing data versus a reference
genome (and the `SAM` format is a signature of this: it stores data in terms of
reference genome coordinates). In the future, SV visualization may look more
similar to comparative genomics, where we compare an SV to a population specific
reference from a graph genomes or something like this.

It is known that _de novo_ assembly has more power to detect SVs than some read
operations (https://twitter.com/lh3lh3/status/1362921612690010118/photo/1 as _de
novo_ assembled genomes improve and become more widespread, we may see a shift
in how SVs are called

I would also like to see improved ability to do fast or 'on the fly' gene
prediction on the _de novo_ assembled genomes, and we can see what SNPs or
modified splicing might look like in copies of genes (e.g. derived regions of
the CNV duplications).

Fun fact: the
[`GAF`](https://github.com/lh3/gfatools/blob/master/doc/rGFA.md#the-graph-alignment-format-gaf)
(graphical alignment format) is a strict superset of
[`PAF`](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md) (pairwise alignment
format) by storing graph node labels in the `target name` slot of `PAF`, and can
refer to an `rGFA` (reference genome graph)! Looking forward to the graph genome
world.

## Conclusion

Algorithms that actually call structural variants face many challenges, but
understanding how the reads are encoded in SAM format, and seeing what they look
like in the genome browser is a useful first step to gaining a better
understanding.

In summary, some of the signatures of SVs may include:

- Aberrant insert size (`TLEN`) detection (longer for deletion, shorter for
  insertion)
- Aberrant pair orientation (pairs are not pointing at each other)
- Split-read detection (`SA` tag)
- `CIGAR` string processing (`D` operator for deletions, `I` operator for
  insertions)
- Over-abundance of clipping (`S` or `H` operators in `CIGAR`)
- Depth of coverage changes for CNVs
- Aligning _de novo_ assembly vs a reference genome
  (https://twitter.com/lh3lh3/status/1362921612690010118/photo/1) which can
  output `SAM`, but it can also output
  [`PAF`](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md) format (which can
  be loaded in JBrowse 2 in the synteny views). Techniques of detecting SVs on
  PAF will be fundamentally pretty similar to the techniques listed above but
  may look a bit different (see `cs` tag in `PAF` for example, it is a modified
  `CIGAR`-like string)

If you have any ideas I should include here, let me know!

### Appendix A: Interpreting pair orientation

This may be unnecessarily low level code for this article, but it could be
helpful utility to help determine the pair orientation from a single
SAM/BAM/CRAM record.

```ts
// @param flags - flags from a single read
// @param ref - the string of the reference sequence, just used to determine if it matches rnext
// @param rnext - the string of the RNEXT, just used to determine if it matches ref
// @param tlen - the TLEN field from SAM
// @return e.g. F1R2 normal paired end orientation
function getPairOrientation(
  flags: number,
  ref: string,
  rnext: string,
  tlen: number,
) {
  // this read is not unmapped &&
  // this read's mate is also not unmapped &&
  // this read's mate is on the same reference genome
  if (!flags & 4 && !flags & 8 && ref === rnext) {
    const s1 = flags & 16 ? 'R' : 'F'
    const s2 = flags & 32 ? 'R' : 'F'
    let o1 = ' '
    let o2 = ' '

    // if first in pair
    if (flags & 64) {
      o1 = '1'
      o2 = '2'
    }

    // else if second in pair
    else if (flags & 128) {
      o1 = '2'
      o2 = '1'
    }

    const tmp = []
    if (tlen > 0) {
      tmp[0] = s1
      tmp[1] = o1
      tmp[2] = s2
      tmp[3] = o2
    } else {
      tmp[2] = s1
      tmp[3] = o1
      tmp[0] = s2
      tmp[1] = o2
    }
    return tmp.join('')
  }
  return null
}
```

Then this can be broken down further by orientation type

- Paired end reads are "fr"
- Mate pair reads are "rf"

So you can interpret e.g. F1R2 in relation to being a paired end read (fr) or
mate pair (rf) below and with this link
https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/interpreting_pair_orientations

```json
{
  "fr": {
    "F1R2": "LR",
    "F2R1": "LR",

    "F1F2": "LL",
    "F2F1": "LL",

    "R1R2": "RR",
    "R2R1": "RR",

    "R1F2": "RL",
    "R2F1": "RL"
  },

  "rf": {
    "R1F2": "LR",
    "R2F1": "LR",

    "R1R2": "LL",
    "R2R1": "LL",

    "F1F2": "RR",
    "F2F1": "RR",

    "F1R2": "RL",
    "F2R1": "RL"
  }
}
```

### Appendix B - `CIGAR` parsing

```ts
// @param cigar: CIGAR string in text form
// @returns an array of elements like ['30','M', '2','I', '50','M', '40','D']
// which you can consume in a loop two elements at a time
function parseCigar(cigar: string) {
  return cigar.split(/([MIDNSHPX=])/)
}
```

Then parse the returned array two at a time

```ts
// this function does nothing, but is informative for how to parse interpret a
// CIGAR string
// @param cigar:CIGAR string from record
// @param readSeq: the SEQ from record
// @param refSeq: the reference sequence underlying the read
function interpretCigar(cigar: string, readSeq: string, refSeq: string) {
  const opts = parseCigar(cigar)
  let qpos = 0 // query position, position on the read
  let tpos = 0 // target position, position on the reference sequence
  for (let i = 0; i < ops.length; i += 2) {
    const length = +opts[i]
    const operator = opts[i + 1]
    // do things. refer to the CIGAR chart in SAMv1.pdf for which operators
    // "consume reference" to see whether to increment
    if (op === 'M' || op === '=') {
      // matches consume query and reference
      const refMatch = refSeq.slice(tpos, tpos + len)
      const readMatch = readSeq.slice(qpos, qpos + len)
      for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (refMatch[i] !== readMatch[i]) {
          // SNP at this position
        }
      }
      qpos += len
      tpos += len
    }
    if (op === 'I') {
      // insertions only consume query
      // sequence of the insertion from the read is
      const insSeq = readSeq.slice(qpos, qpos + len)
      qpos += len
    }
    if (op === 'D') {
      // deletions only consume reference
      // sequence of the deletion from the reference is
      const delSeq = refSeq.slice(tpos, tpos + len)
      tpad += len
    }
    if (op === 'N') {
      // skips only consume reference
      // skips are similar to deletions but are related to spliced alignments
      tpad += len
    }
    if (op === 'X') {
      // mismatch using the extended CIGAR format
      // could lookup the mismatch letter in a string containing the reference
      const mismatch = refSeq.slice(tpos, tpos + len)
      qpos += len
      tpos += len
    }
    if (op === 'H') {
      // does not consume query or reference
      // hardclip is just an indicator
    }
    if (op === 'S') {
      // softclip consumes query
      // below gets the entire soft clipped portion
      const softClipStr = readSeq.slice(qpos, qpos + len)
      qpos += len
    }
  }
}
```

Note for example, that to determine how long a record is on the reference
sequence, you have to combine the records start position with the CIGAR string,
basically parsing the CIGAR string to add up tpos and return tpos

### Appendix C - align `FASTQ` directly to `CRAM`

This example from the htslib documentation
(http://www.htslib.org/workflow/fastq.html shows how you can stream directly
from `FASTQ` to `CRAM` (and generate the index file .crai too)

If you want, you can make this a little shell script, easy_align_shortreads.sh

easy_align_shortreads.sh

```sh
#!/bin/bash
minimap2 -t 8 -a -x sr "$1" "$2" "$3"  | \
samtools fixmate -u -m - - | \
samtools sort -u -@2 - | \
samtools markdup -@8 --reference "$1" - --write-index "$4"
```

Similar idea for longreads, except just a single fastq file is generally used
for longreads

easy_align_longreads.sh

```sh
#!/bin/bash
minimap2 -t 8 -a "$1" "$2"  | \
samtools fixmate -u -m - - | \
samtools sort -u -@2 - | \
samtools markdup -@8 --reference "$1" - --write-index "$3"
```

Then call

```sh
bash easy_align_shortreads.sh ref.fa reads1.fq reads2.fq out.cram
bash easy_align_longreads.sh ref.fa reads.fq out.cram

## output BAM instead
bash easy_align_shortreads.sh ref.fa reads1.fq reads2.fq out.bam
bash easy_align_longreads.sh ref.fa reads.fq out.bam
```

This same concept works with other common aligners as well like bwa

Bonus: CRAM to bigwig, for looking at CNV/coverage

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# quickalign.sh ref.fa 1.fq 2.fq out.cram
# produces out.cram and out.bw
samtools faidx $1
minimap2 -t 8 -a -x sr "$1" "$2" "$3"  | \
samtools fixmate -u -m - - | \
samtools sort -u -@2 - | \
samtools markdup -@8 --reference "$1" - --write-index "$4"


mosdepth $4 -f $1 $4
gunzip $4.per-base.bed.gz
bedGraphToBigWig $4.per-base.bed $1.fa.fai $4.bw
```

Call as "quickalign.sh ref.fa 1.fq 2.fq out.cram" gives you out.cram,
out.cram.crai, and out.cram.bw (coverage)

### Appendix D - the `MD` tag and finding SNPs in reads

The `MD` tag helps tell you where the mismatches are without looking at the
reference genome. This is useful because as I mentioned, `CIGAR` can say `50M`
(50 matches) but some letters inside those 50 matches can be mismatches, it only
says there are no insertions/deletions in those 50 bases, but you have to
determine where in those 50 bases where the mismatches are. The `MD` tag can
help tell you where those are, but it is somewhat complicated to decode
(https://vincebuffalo.com/notes/2014/01/17/md-tags-in-bam-files.html). You have
to combine it with the `CIGAR` to get the position of the mismatches on the
reference genome. If you have a reference genome to look at, you might just
compare all the bases within the 50M to the reference genome and look for
mismatches yourself and forget about the `MD` tag

The `MD` tag is also not required to exist, but the command
`samtools calmd yourfile.bam --reference reference.fa` can add `MD` tags to your
`BAM` file. It is generally not useful for `CRAM` because `CRAM` actually does
store mismatches with the reference genome in it's compression format. Note that
there are also some oddities about `MD` tag representation leading to complaints
(e.g. https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/issues/505) leading more credence to
"doing it yourself" e.g. finding your own mismatches by comparing the read
sequence with the reference, keeping track of where you are on the read and ref
position with the `CIGAR` string (a la Appendix B)
