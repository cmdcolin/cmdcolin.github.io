title: Using Rust/WASM in a monorepo with create-react-app
date: 2022-08-22
---

Behold, the buzzwords:

- Rust / WASM / wasm-bindgen
- React
- Monorepo / Yarn workspaces
- Webpack 5 / create-react-app 5
- Typescript

The main goal here: To use Rust + WASM in a react app, inside a monorepo.

TLDR: visit the final product!
[https://github.com/cmdcolin/rust_react_monorepo_template](https://github.com/cmdcolin/rust_react_monorepo_template).
It is also deployed live here
[https://cmdcolin.github.io/rust_react_monorepo_template](https://cmdcolin.github.io/rust_react_monorepo_template)

## Steps to create this type of integration from scratch

### Create repo

```
mkdir template
cd template
git init
```

### Create root `package.json`

Then put this in the monorepo's root `package.json`

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["hello-wasm", "app"]
}
```

This sets our repo up as a "monorepo" with two "workspaces". one will be the
wasm code, in `hello-wasm`, one will be an instance of `create-react-app`

### Add a `create-react-app` instance inside the monorepo

```sh
npx create-react-app --template typescript app
```

This will make an `app` subfolder inside our monorepo

### Download the hello world rust `wasm-bindgen` example and put it in a folder named `hello-wasm`

Download [https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/main/examples/hello_world](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/main/examples/hello_world) to the hello-wasm folder

This link can help [https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frustwasm%2Fwasm-bindgen%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fhello_world](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frustwasm%2Fwasm-bindgen%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fhello_world)

### Add some extra fields to the `package.json` in the `hello-wasm` folder

```json
{
  "name": "hello-wasm",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "files": ["pkg"],
  "main": "pkg/index.js"
  ... rest
}
```

### Modify the `hello-wasm` example to return a value instead of making an alert

I changed the rust code to return a String value instead of making an alert box

```
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello {}", name)
}
```

### Build the `hello-wasm` pkg

Go into the `hello-wasm` folder and run `yarn build`. This creates a directory
named `pkg` which has `.wasm` files and `.js` files. Now, the `hello-wasm`
folder is effectively a node package. We could publish this to `NPM` (see
footnote 1)

### Add the `hello-wasm` package to the `app` dependencies

Add `"hello-wasm":"^1.0.0"` to the `dependencies` array in `app/package.json`. This
will refer to our local monorepo's rust wasm package!

### Create craco config for `create-react-app`

As of writing, with `webpack` v5/`create-react-app` v5, you have to customize
the `create-react-app` to add extra `webpack` flags.

So, `yarn add @craco/craco` in the app folder, then create this `craco.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    configure: (config) => {
      const wasmExtensionRegExp = /\.wasm$/;
      config.resolve.extensions.push(".wasm");
      config.experiments = {
        syncWebAssembly: true,
      };

      config.module.rules.forEach((rule) => {
        (rule.oneOf || []).forEach((oneOf) => {
          if (oneOf.type === "asset/resource") {
            oneOf.exclude.push(wasmExtensionRegExp);
          }
        });
      });

      return config;
    },
  },
};
```

Note: this thread helped me to create the craco config

Also see footnote 2 for more info

### Final step: Use async `import()` to import the `hello-wasm` greeting

We use a `useEffect` hook to import the code asynchronously, and can call our
rust function, `greet`, from javascript!

```tsx
function App() {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState<string>();
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      try {
        const wasm = await import("hello-wasm");
        const greeting = wasm.greet("Colin");
        setGreeting(greeting);
      } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>rust monorepo wasm demo</h1>
      <h2>Greeting from wasm: {!greeting ? "Loading..." : greeting}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In order to greet an arbitrary person, I modified this slightly in the live
demo. See
[https://github.com/cmdcolin/rust_react_monorepo_template/blob/master/app/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/cmdcolin/rust_react_monorepo_template/blob/master/app/src/App.tsx)

### Run the app!

Go into the `app` folder, and then run `yarn start`

## Result!

via rust and wasm

## Conclusion

My main aim was to demonstrate creating a "simple" monorepo setup showing how
you can integrate Rust+WASM and React. Feel free to ask me any questions and go
check out the repo!

## Other resources

This article is quite helpful also, but uses a file:/ reference in their
`package.json` while my approach uses a monorepo, it is fundamentally quite
similar though!
[https://tkat0.github.io/posts/how-to-create-a-react-app-with-rust-and-wasm](https://tkat0.github.io/posts/how-to-create-a-react-app-with-rust-and-wasm)

## Footnote 1: The `hello-wasm` folder IS a npm package with wasm files

The `hello-wasm` folder can be published to NPM by itself. When consumers of
the package import the module, they would receive `pkg/index.js` from the
`main` field in `package.json`, and then `pkg/index.js` in turn imports the
`index.wasm` file. Then it is up to the consumers bundler to package that
correctly.

## Footnote 2: Bundlers and wasm

As of writing, I am using `webpack` v5 (part of `create-react-app` v5), which has
"native support" for wasm. Still, it is hidden behind a flag called
"experiments" (see first google result for webpack wasm here
[https://webpack.js.org/configuration/experiments/](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/experiments/))
so I use `@craco/craco` to modify the `webpack` config of `create-react-app` v5 to
add this.

Note also: The first time I wrote this, I used `webpack` v4, which used a
slightly different workflow (used a special `webpack` loader called
`wasm-loader`)

You can also likely use similar techniques described in this article to
incorporate into `next.js` since it also uses `webpack`. If you have info on
how other bundlers use wasm, feel free to leave a comment.

## Footnote 3: Why do I have to use async imports?

Fundamentally, the `.wasm` file has to be fetched asynchronously before it can
be run (it is not in my experience e.g. embedded as binary data inside a js
file) which means it would be difficult to use the wasm code as a synchronous
import.

There are hints that this may be possible but it would rely on the bundler
embedding the wasm code in the js itself, or maybe top-level-await. If anyone
has more info, feel free to leave a comment!

## Footnote 4: Build setup

The `hello-wasm` package does not automatically recompile when we are running
e.g. `yarn start` in the `app` folder. Therefore, changes to the rust requires
you to manually run `yarn build` in the `hello-wasm` folder. Just something to
be aware of

## Footnote 5: My first experience with trying to make this work was rocky!

I first created an example of rust+wasm+react almost two years ago when
creating a fractal viewer
[https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map](https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map)
and it has some development notes on the stumbling blocks I faced
[https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map/blob/master/NOTES.md](https://github.com/cmdcolin/logistic_chaos_map/blob/master/NOTES.md)

## Footnote 6: I thought you said typescript too

Yep! The `hello-wasm` example generates typescript `.d.ts` files! Check out the
`hello-wasm/pkg/` folder after you build it! This was none of my doing, just a
built-in feature. PS: I highly recommend inspecting the `pkg` folder that is
produced in the `hello-wasm` build to help understand the details.
