title: Watch out for your pinky finger (AND elbow posture)
date: 2022-07-08

I have, for several months, suffered a twinge in my left pinky finger from
excessive strain due to hand contortions largely caused by keyboard use.

Particularly troublesome in my opinion has been the use of the left-ctrl key
for keyboard shortcuts.

Update Sep 2022: I have also come to realize that this can be strongly related
to elbow posture, so I added sections on this.

### Programs that are particularly troublesome for the left pinky

- many programs: ctrl+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+x, ctrl+f
- terminal: shift+ctrl+v to paste
- tmux: default ctrl+somekey as leader
- chrome: ctrl+w to close tab, ctrl+t for new tab, ctrl+r for refresh,
  shift+ctrl+r for cache-cleared refresh
- vim: using esc key on the far left, custom configurations using ctrl key e.g.
  ctrl+p (I also had ctrl+g, ctrl+f for custom file finders for awhile but no
  longer)

In order to make these movements, particularly if you use the left hand to do
it, you have to contort your hand pretty drastically. Chrome is particularly
bad because it is not possible(?) to reconfigure their keyboard shortcuts.

Unfortunately, I did not really listen to warning signs from my hand, and now
there is a mild pain from almost any keyboard usage

### General approaches to help out

- Take time out of my day e.g. pomodoro to take rests
- Do hand exercises and stretches when idle
- Massages to the muscles
- Using touch typing, making my hands float above the keyboard when typing
- Avoiding curling up the pinky while typing, keep hand relaxed
- Use both hands to execute shortcuts instead of contorting left hand

### Update: Avoiding elbow/ulnar nerve strain

Picture from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_tunnel_syndrome

I have come to realize that the pinky finger and ring finger are strongly
related to the elbow and ulnar nerve, also known as your funnybone. This can
cause issues sometimes called "ulnar tunnel" or "cubital tunnel" which is
relatively distinct from "carpal tunnel" and is more strongly related to the
ring and pinky fingers! You can get ring/pinky pain from compression of the
nerve near the wrist or near the elbow, but the elbow is quite common.

Some notes about improving elbow ergonomics

- Avoid applying too much pressure to elbows on armrests (ulnar nerve) while at
  desk
- Avoid typing with elbows bent e.g. straighten arms
- Avoid sleeping with elbows super bent e.g. I get this sleeping on my stomach
  with my elbows under my body. Use ulnar/elbow brace for sleeping. I am
  ordering one of these to try out

### Technical approaches and key remappings for pinky ergonomics

- Remap caps lock to left+ctrl. This is a common one you hear recommended and
  it may help, and it has less contortion, particularly for chrome with one
  hand use. So you can say capslock+w, capslock+t, but it is still using pinky
  and can be stressful if not careful (capslock+w fine, capslock+t still
  contortion if done with one hand)
- More use of the right-hand-only shortcuts or at least avoiding using the left
  pinky for shortcuts. I don't have many of these but will look into retraining
  myself for some of these. I am testing out right ctrl+] for leader in tmux,
  and - and = for split window horizontal and vertical

### Things still to try: better ergonomics and gadgets

In truth, I type a lot on a laptop with a poor keyboard layout, and often use
it away from a desk. I think improving my desk ergonomics could help, and
getting a fancy keyboard and maybe mouse (though I much prefer a touchpad)
could be a next frontier, along with ensuring proper desk height, chair height,
etc.

## Conclusion

It is not great to get to this point. My hand posture and body posture at the
keyboard has been bad for years, and it has caught up to me. Learning the
connection with my elbow and ulnar nerve was very enlightening for my
situation. The common problem many people discuss is carpal tunnel related, but
the ulnar is actually a relatively separate problem, though related in many
ways too. I recommend people be aware of contorting their hand or applying
pressure on their elbows too much, lest they suffer the same!

otherwise)
