title: A spooky error when you have a string bigger than 512MB in Chrome

Now gather round for a spooky story

Late one night... in the haunted office space castle (hindenbugs cackling in
the background amongst the dusty technical books) the midnight candles were
burning bright and we entered data for a user file

A simple 52MB gzipped datafile that we want to process in the browser. We unzip
it, decode it, and ...an error

ERROR: data not found

![](/media/pumpkin-dark.jpg)

But... our code is so simple (we of course abide by the religion of writing "simple code" you know)...what could be happening?

The code looks like this

```js
const buf = unzip(file)
const str = new TextDecoder().decode(buf)
```

We trace it back and run a console.log(str)

It looks empty. We try running console.log(str.length) ... it prints out 0

But if we console.log(buffer.length) we get 546,483,710 bytes...

What could be happening?

We see in the TextDecoder documentation that it has a note called "fatal". We try

```js
const buf = unzip(file)
const str = new TextDecoder('utf8', { fatal: true }).decode(buf)
```

This doesn't change the results though

Then it dawns on us while the lightning hits and the thunderclap booms and the
wind blows through the rattly windows

We have hit...the maximum string length in Chrome

BWAHAHAHAHA

The maximum string length!!! Nooooooo

It is 512MB on the dot... 536,870,888 bytes. We test this to be sure

```
const len = 536_870_888;
const buf = new Uint8Array(len);
for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  buf[i] = "a".charCodeAt(0);
}
const str = new TextDecoder().decode(buf);
console.log(str.length);

```

This is correct, outputs 536,870,888

With anything, even one byte more, it fails and outputs 0

happy halloween!!

chrome 95 tested

nodejs 15 - at 512MB+1 bytes it prints an error message `Error: Cannot create a string longer than 0x1fffffe8 characters` for significantly greater than 512MB
e.g. 600MB it actually prints a different error `TypeError [ERR_ENCODING_INVALID_ENCODED_DATA]: The encoded data was not valid for encoding utf-8`)

firefox 93 - goes up to ~1GB but then gives Exception { name: "NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY", message: "", result: 2147942414

midori 6 (safari-alike/webkit) - goes up to ~2GB fine! will have to test more
