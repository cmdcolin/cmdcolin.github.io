title: Memoizing async functions so that you don't cache errors

There are two hard problems in computer science:
[Cache invalidation and naming things](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html).
In this post we'll show how memoize an async function, and how to invalidate the
memoization when the promise throws an error.

This helps us with being able to re-try because since the error is not cached,
calling it again after an error retries automatically.

Example async function:

```js
async function getData() {
  const ret = await fetch('https://some.hardcoded.resource/file.json')
  if (!ret.ok) {
    throw new Error(
      `Failed to fetch ${url} HTTP ${ret.status} ${await ret.text()}`,
    )
  }
  return ret.json()
}
```

Here is a technique that can be used to memoize this function

```js
function getDataMemoized() {
  if (!this.promise) {
    this.promise = getData().catch(e => {
      this.promise = undefined
      throw e
    })
  }
  return this.promise
}
```

The promise is held in this.promise, and the important part of this function is
that when I get an error, I clear this.promise and re-throw the error. The
caller of the function, on error, will receive the error message, but caching
will not take place, allowing retries to take place later on.


## Footnote 0: Arguments to function

If your function takes arguments, then you can use a hash map associating the
argument with the promise. You may also consider using an LRU cache so that your
hash map doesn't grow infinitely in size

Generally you need a way to stringify or otherwise make them able to be stored
in a Map or Object to do this.

## Footnote 1: Error handling of `fetch`

This demo also demonstrates some basic fetch error handling, and uses
`await response.text()` to get the error message from the API. Sometimes an api
will return it's error in JSON format, so you can handle that as is, sometimes
you have to check both text and json

Note also, that response.statusText does
[not exist in HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/statusText)
so it's better to use `response.text()` or `response.json()`.

## Footnote 2: Global cache

You could also keep a cache in a global variable, or as a property on a class,
or other methods. I have also found it useful to have a specific function for
clearing the cache, so you can get a clean slate each time a test runs in unit
testing or similar

```js
let promise
async function getDataMemoized() {
  if (!promise) {
    promise = getData().catch(e => {
      promise = undefined
      throw e
    })
  }
  return promise
}

function clearCache() {
  promise = undefined
}
```

You can also make a general purpose utility to memoize any promise function

```js
function memoize(fn) {
  let promise
  return () => {
    if (!promise) {
      promise = fn().catch(e => {
        promise = undefined
        throw e
      })
    }
  }
}
```

## Footnote 3 - Aborting

If you want to handle aborting, it is a bit trickier. Aborting in javascript is
handled by
[AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/AbortController).
This is an object that gives you an
[AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that
can be passed to fetch calls and the like to stop a big download from happening.

In our above example, if we passed an abort signal to the first call to fetch,
and then aborted it, it would abort the fetch,
[which throws a DOMException called "AbortError"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/abort).
You can detect that it is an AbortError like this, and may choose not to display
or re-throw the abort exception

```js
function isAbortException(e) {
  return e instanceof Error && exception.name === 'AbortError'
}
```

Now, what if 5 functions call getDataMemoized(), all passing different abort
signals. What if the first one aborts? Then all the rest will get aborted also.
But what if we only want to abort the cached call if literally all of them
aborted? Then we may have to synthesize an AbortController inside our function

```js
let promise
let abortcontroller
let listeners = 0
async function getDataMemoized(signal) {
  if (!promise) {
    abortcontroller = new AbortController()

    // synthesize a new signal instead of using the passed in signal
    promise = getData(abortcontroller.signal).catch(e => {
      promise = undefined
      throw e
    })
  }
  if (signal) {
    listeners++
    // add listener to the passed in signal
    signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
      listeners--
      if (listeners === 0) {
        abortcontroller.abort()
      }
    })
  }
  return promise
}
```

My team created,
[abortable-promise-cache](https://github.com/GMOD/abortable-promise-cache),
tries to help with this scenario with a cleaner abstraction.

## Footnote 4

This blog post mentioned in a comment thread https://zansh.in/memoizer.html has
great interactive examples and shows the "invalidate on .catch()" behavior!
