title: My next.js static blog setup
date: 2021-12-26
---

My personal homepage originally used statocles, a perl-based static site
generator (http://preaction.me/statocles/). I didn't really blog using it, just
a homepage for myself plus some links to my tumblr blog. But, if I linked
people to the tumblr blog directly, it would give people terrible popup ads and
trackers. So, I switched to github pages+next.js this year. I considered a
number of alternative static site systems, but next.js seemed to hit some nice
goals

- Flexible
- React-based (as opposed to template-based like jekyll, eleventy, etc.)
- Markdown driven, and can use MDX
- RSS feed (bonus)
- Active community

Other systems almost worked and were attempted but aborted

### First and second iterations

The first iteration of my next.js blog

- I put every blog post in the "pages" folder. This worked ok but I had to
  manually edit the index.mdx file to have long lists of stuff like this
  `![link to new blogpost](manually_inserted_link_here)`

The second iteration of using next.js

- aimed to be a little more idiomatic about next.js usage, so I used the next.js
  "blog-template-typescript" example folder from their monorepo
  [monorepo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript).

- The new blog posts are generated from markdown files placed in the `_posts`
  folder, and get rendered by `pages/posts/[slug].tsx` (yes, the filename
  includes square brackets).

- I also use a function in [`lib/api.ts`](https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/blob/master/lib/api.ts) to get lists of the files in \_posts to generate the blog [`archive.mdx`](https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/blob/master/pages/archive.mdx) page (also, the index displays the first 8 elements of the archive, using the same `lib/api.ts` file)

### Creating a bare bones next.js blog setup

I started out using the `blog-starter-typescript` example from next.js
[here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript).

This template has a number of things that I don't particularly like so I
stripped out a lot of excess to try to get to a more minimal boilerplate

Example: they have a component folder with many tiny components, while my repo
stripped out many of these leaving a fairly minimal setup

- [theirs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript/components)
- [mine](https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/tree/master/components)

### Removing tailwind CSS

The `blog-starter-typescript` example has a pretty "modern style" (read:
gigantic tiles instead of links, images that are 800px tall and 1600px wide,
for their "hero-post").

I removed these "modern" things for a more minimal style :)

But, it still used tailwind CSS, so I decided to try to roll with it for a bit, but ended up removing it eventually

Tailwind CSS has a sort of bootstrap-type system with many hundreds of
different CSS class names instead of using normal CSS styles.

Example html tags using tailwind CSS:

```html
<div className="container mx-auto px-5">{children}</div>
<footer className="bg-accent-1 border-t border-accent-2"></footer>
<div className="max-w-1xl mx-auto"></div>
<div className="min-h-screen"></div>
<a className="hover:underline"></a>
<h1
  className="text-2xl md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl font-bold tracking-tighter leading-tight md:leading-none mb-12 text-center md:text-left"
></h1>
```

I personally found these quite hard to read, maybe there is an enterprise
niceness to it (the hivemind often refers to tailwind as being able to scale
CSS better) but didn't seem that great for a personal blog.

I tried to play with it for a little while, glanced at some docs to figure out
how to do simple things like padding, but...I reached a breakpoint point with
tailwind when trying to combine with markdown. The reason?

Using tailwind CSS resets a lot of HTML styles so things like `<h1>`, `<h2>`,
`<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>` have no styling at all.

Stackoverflow has some ways to help, but it still struck me as odd. Examples

- [Example: you have to manually restore underlines on `<a>` elements if using tailwind XSS](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68853223/2129219)

- [Another example: "It looks like you're using TailwindCSS, the default
  styles for elements are reset, that's why the h1 text will look like any other
  text."](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69264976/cant-display-markdown-on-nextjs)

There are interesting workarounds here, but I was not really a fan of this idea
that h1 is just like any other text. The `blog-template-typescript` uses [this
file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel/next.js/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript/components/markdown-styles.module.css)
to try to style the markdown using some general styles, but to me, it was still
quite surprising the degree that tailwind goes to try to reset all styles

I removed tailwind CSS, and instantly all my markdown rendered properly with
headings and lists nicer, so my blog now looks very 2001 or so, with very basic
style. If I had font times new roman, it'd look even more ancient.

## Using MDX for blogposts in next.js

In the template from next.js team, the `blog-template-typescript`, it uses a
fairly simple `lib/markdownToHtml.ts` function right in the
`pages/posts/[slug].tsx` file (the markdown is statically pre-rendered in the
true static blog sense, using the getStaticProps function). This is,
unfortunately, over-simplified for the MDX case, because MDX properly needs to
hydrate the components using react on the client side also

To fix, the module https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote offers a way to
load actual MDX files.

## Adding syntax highlighting the next.js code snippets

I dunno if I did this right but I manually included the prism JS and CSS from a CDN essentially and it worked

https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/blob/aa080193f45cb3e3d11ca1ead2bbd5eb2ae09633/styles/index.css#L14-L15

https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/blob/aa080193f45cb3e3d11ca1ead2bbd5eb2ae09633/pages/_document.tsx#L12-L17

Other methods e.g. adding react-prism in next.config.js (like
https://github.com/mikeesto/next-mdx-prism-example does) I think clashed with
MDXRemote perhaps, or maybe I was tussling with tailwind CSS too much to make a
clear thought out of it, but syntax blocks on my blogposts should now be
properly highlighted

## Bonuses

### Photos page

I now added a photos page, which I am filling with sketches from a notebook I
got from my girlfriend for Christmas! Will add more photos as life goes on

Let me know what you think https://cmdcolin.github.io/photos

### Google Scholar page

I now have a Google Scholar page! Looks pretty comprehensive
https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=--FwzsgAAAAJ

### RSS feed

I also followed this great guide to add a RSS file for next.js
https://ashleemboyer.com/how-i-added-an-rss-feed-to-my-nextjs-site

Link here, for your feed readers
https://cmdcolin.github.io/rss.xml

Nobody uses RSS much anymore, but I do use it (feedly), and I love music
blogs that keep posting on blogspot year after year, and the occasional
programming post is nice too

## End of 2021

COVID has been such a difficult time. It's hard to summarize the feeling of
seeing the live stream of COVID updates, the stress of everyday interactions,
difficulty of seeing friends and family. Feeling thankful for where we're at
thus far, especially happy to see the role bioinformatics has played in the
pandemic, and looking forward to 2022
