title: My next.js static blog setup
date: 2021-12-26
---

TLDR src here [https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io](https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io)

My personal homepage originally used statocles, a perl-based static site
generator (http://preaction.me/statocles/). I didn't really blog using it, just
a homepage for myself plus some links to my tumblr blog. But, if I linked
people to the tumblr blog directly, it would give people terrible popup ads and
trackers. So, I switched to github pages+next.js this year. I considered a
number of alternative static site systems, but next.js seemed to hit some nice
goals

- Flexible
- React-based (as opposed to template-based like jekyll, eleventy, etc.)
- Markdown driven, and can use MDX
- RSS feed (bonus)
- Active community

Other systems almost worked and were attempted but aborted

### First and second iterations

The first iteration of my next.js blog

- I put every blog post in the "pages" folder. This worked ok but I had to
  manually edit the index.mdx file to have long lists of stuff like this
  `![link to new blogpost](manually_inserted_link_here)`

The second iteration, I wanted to automatically generate a list of recent
blogposts from files on disk

- I used the next.js "blog-template-typescript" example folder from their
  [monorepo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript).

- The new blog posts are generated from markdown files in the `_posts` folder,
  and get rendered by the file `pages/posts/[slug].tsx` (yes, the filename
  includes square brackets).

- getAllPosts in  
  [`lib/api.ts`](https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/blob/master/lib/api.ts)
  gets a listing of the files in \_posts folder, which I can call from the `getStaticProps` method on next.js pages

### Stripping off unnecessary stuff from blog-starter-typescript

The `blog-starter-typescript` template has many tiny components, I removed some
of them to make it easier for me to orient myself

- [theirs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript/components)
- [mine](https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/tree/master/components)

### Removing tailwind CSS

The `blog-starter-typescript` template uses tailwind CSS and uses "modern web design" (aka:
gigantic "tiles" instead of links, images that are way too large, etc)

I started making a more basic design. I tried to roll with the tailwind CSS for
a bit, but ended up removing it entirely.

Tailwind CSS is sort of like a CSS-in-JS system, except every CSS attribute is encoded in a CSS classname. For example, here are some tailwind CSS snippets

```html
<div className="container mx-auto px-5"></div>
<footer className="bg-accent-1 border-t border-accent-2"></footer>
<div className="max-w-1xl mx-auto"></div>
<div className="min-h-screen"></div>
<a className="hover:underline"></a>
<h1
  className="text-2xl md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl font-bold tracking-tighter leading-tight md:leading-none mb-12 text-center md:text-left"
></h1>
```

They claim this is better than using external CSS (see comparison here
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) but it is yet another language to
learn, and kind of tricky.

But, the reason I gave up with tailwind is actually because tailwind CSS resets
a lot of HTML styles so things like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>` have
no styling at all. This is done by `tailwind preflight`
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight (which you can disable, but it is
enabled by default)

Stackoverflow has some ways to help restore styling and keep preflight, but it
still struck me as odd. Examples

- [Example: you have to manually restore underlines on `<a>` elements if using tailwind XSS](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68853223/2129219)

- [Another example: "It looks like you're using TailwindCSS, the default
  styles for elements are reset, that's why the h1 text will look like any other
  text."](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69264976/cant-display-markdown-on-nextjs)

- [Another example `blog-template-typescript` uses this file to try to style
  the markdown using some general
  styles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel/next.js/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript/components/markdown-styles.module.css)

To me it was surprising the extend that tailwind goes to unstyle the default
browser styles, removing "idiomatic HTML" styles, so I removed tailwind for
now. Perhaps I'll return to it another time

## Using MDX for blogposts in next.js

In the template from next.js team, the `blog-template-typescript`, it uses a
fairly simple `lib/markdownToHtml.ts` function right in the
`pages/posts/[slug].tsx` file (the markdown is statically pre-rendered in the
true static blog sense, using the getStaticProps function). This is,
unfortunately, over-simplified for the MDX case, because MDX properly needs to
hydrate the components using react on the client side also

To fix, the module https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote offers a way to
load actual MDX files.

## Adding syntax highlighting the next.js code snippets

There are a couple results from google about how to add syntax highlighting to
next.js but I still found it difficult.

My method ended up a bit different where I manually included the prism JS and
CSS from a CDN essentially and it worked

https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/blob/aa080193f45cb3e3d11ca1ead2bbd5eb2ae09633/styles/index.css#L14-L15

https://github.com/cmdcolin/cmdcolin.github.io/blob/aa080193f45cb3e3d11ca1ead2bbd5eb2ae09633/pages/_document.tsx#L12-L17

Other methods e.g. adding react-prism in next.config.js (like
https://github.com/mikeesto/next-mdx-prism-example does) I think clashed with
MDXRemote perhaps, or maybe I was tussling with tailwind CSS too much to make a
clear thought out of it, but syntax blocks on my blogposts should now be
properly highlighted

## RSS feed

I also followed this great guide to add a RSS file for next.js
https://ashleemboyer.com/how-i-added-an-rss-feed-to-my-nextjs-site

Link here, for your feed readers
https://cmdcolin.github.io/rss.xml

Not many people may use RSS much anymore, but I do use it (via feedly), and I
love music blogs that keep posting on blogspot year after year, and the
occasional programming post is nice too
