title: Creating a JBrowse plugin

I have been very impressed with peoples creativity and willingness to
dig into all the details of JBrowse to customize it's features. One
great way to do this in a modular way is to create a "JBrowse plugin".
This concept sounds hard but you can set up a simple couple of files and
refresh your browser and it will "just work"!

**Introduction to the plugin mindset**

In a plugin, you can define new things like custom track types, custom
adaptors to new file types, new track selectors, or something really
different. A key insight about the custom types of tracks and things
though is that you can put the name of your new custom class in the
jbrowse config file which will then find the code in your plugin and run
it. Plugins can do other things, but the ability to just swap out track
types or other components in the config file is a great benefit.

**A scenario**

One example that was talked about on the mailing list might involve
adding new menu items for a given track. We might consider a plugin that
defines a custom track type to add that functionality.

Basically, we can use object- oriented principles to "inherit" from some
existing track type like CanvasFeatures and then extend its
functionality by overriding the functions.

If you are not familiar with object-oriented javascript, dojo makes it
pretty easy (but, especially get a background on this if you need to,
see footnotes below).

We can inherit a new track type by using the "define" function to
include the dependencies needed in a file, and they are listed in an
array at the top of your file.

Then the "declare" function creates a new class. The first argument to
declare is the is your parent class, like CanvasFeatures, and we type
"return declare" because we are returning our new track class from the
module.

```
 define( ["dojo/_base/declare",
 "JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasFeatures"],
     function(declare,CanvasFeatures) {
     return declare(CanvasFeatures, {
         _trackMenuOptions: function() {

             var opts=this.inherited(arguments); //call the parent
 classes function

             opts.push( // add an extra menu item to the array returned
 from parent class function
                 {       
                     label: "Custom item",
                     type: 'dijit/CheckedMenuItem',
                     onClick: function(event) {
                         console.log('Clicked');
                     },  
                     iconClass: "dijitIconPackage"
                 }   
             );  
             return opts;
         }   
     });
     }   
 );
```

Code listing 1. an example custom track type, MyTrack.js, that adds an
extra track menu item

**Now how do we make this a plugin?**

In the above section, we created a new track subclass with a custom menu
option. How do we use this track? We want to turn it into part of afine
the boilerplate code from the [Writing
plugins](http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Writing_JBrowse_Plugins)
guide.

```js
 define([
            'dojo/_base/declare',
            'JBrowse/Plugin'
        ],  
        function(
            declare,
            JBrowsePlugin
        ) {
  
 return declare( JBrowsePlugin, // our plugin's main.js derives from
 the "JBrowse/Plugin" base class
 {
     constructor: function( args ) {
         /*don't necessarily have to do any initializing here, but you
 can get a handle to various jbrowse components if any initialization
 is needed from the args.browser variable*/
     }   
 });
 });
```

Code listing 2. Our plugin's main.js

After this, we create the plugin directory structure

> jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin
>
> > jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin/js
> >
> > > jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin/js/main.js
> > >
> > > jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin/js/MyTrack.js

Then we can add our new plugin to a config file like jbrowse_conf.json
as "plugins": ["MyPlugin"]  and then make a track in trackList.json
have "type":  "MyPlugin/MyTrack" instead of for
example "type": "CanvasFeatures". That will tell jbrowse to load the
MyTrack class from your plugin instead of the normal CanvasFeatures
class.

That's about it!

Note that the bin/new-plugin.pl script can automatically initialize some
of this directory structure too. Try running "bin/new-plugin.pl
MyPlugin" and see what happens.

Footnotes:

It is important to understand the module format (AMD) which is what the
"define" function is about and the dojo way of definining classes using
the "declare" function. Together, this allows the dojo to create
object-oriented programs that are modular in javascript. See
http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.10/dojo/_base/declare.html
and http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.9/modules/
(understanding this helps you understand the "preamble" for declaring a
jbrowse plugin)
