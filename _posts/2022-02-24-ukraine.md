As Russia is actively invading Ukraine my heart goes out to them.

Even if I had no personal connection with Ukraine, I would find this abhorrent,
but I do have personal connections to Ukraine in various ways that makes me
think of them more fondly

My first, and so far only, consulting job was with a company in Ukraine, around 2012. I helped them configure JBrowse, and prepared an official looking word
document with recommendations and hours (a total of like...2 hours) and they
were very nice.

Stand strong Ukraine
