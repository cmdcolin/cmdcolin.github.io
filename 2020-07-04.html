I started learning React in earnest
in 2019. It was a difficult experience overall, but I wanted to go over my
learning experience, and maybe find some lessons in the mix.  This goes mostly
into personal details and doesn&#x27;t really get too technical, however, I review
the commit logs and try and backtrace my feelings that I remember at the time.</p><p>If I were to take away anything from this, it&#x27;s probably that pair programming
was really useful especially as a remote worker, I had nothing before that
except weekly standups where I felt really depressed. Also stay patient, stay
thankful, and try to focus while you learn</p><p><strong>Introduction to me</strong></p><p>I am maybe what you&#x27;d call a front-end engineer. I have done web development
for about 7 years now. I worked on various fast-becoming-legacy projects and
greenfield that were made in Ruby, PHP, Perl CGI, Java servlets, etc.</p><p><strong>Early dabbles with React circa 2016</strong></p><p>I had a random <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> that I was tasked with making and I wanted to code and
wanted to try using React. I tried importing React via a CDN  and gave it a
shot, and it seemed simple enough, but I kept getting really confused about how
to even read and initialize the value of a textbox for example properly. TLDR:
I was not aware of what a <em>controlled component</em> was.</p><p>The idea of controlled components quite unintuitive and I didn&#x27;t know the words
for it. Instead, I kept googling weird things like &quot;two way data binding react&quot;
and variants of this (I had never used angular but I heard of two-way data
binding from angular, and I just felt like it was what I needed). I even posted
about my frustrations about this on the react subreddit and was downvoted. Felt
bad. I was just really confused.  I abandoned the project in react and just
used our normal jqueryish thing.</p><p><strong>New job in 2018</strong></p><p>When I got a call about a new job in 2018, I was really happy and started in
June 2018. They decided they are going to do &quot;the big rewrite&quot; and are going to
use React. My coworker started building the new react app prototype. My
coworker keeps asking me &quot;what state management library should we use&quot;. I just
had no idea about React still, I had not ever looked into state management, and
basically just was like &quot;I dunno!&quot;. I had no way to form an opinion. I was also
working on some misc stuff sort of unrelated to the rewrite and remained pretty
out of the loop. We would have weekly meetings but I just wouldn&#x27;t really
understand the goings ons. This didn&#x27;t feel great</p><p><strong>I am floundering...not understanding what&#x27;s going on with the rewrite</strong></p><p>It&#x27;s December 2018, I go home for Christmas and I have an honest talk with my
parents and tell them &quot;I don&#x27;t get what is happening in the new codebase, I&#x27;m
honestly unhappy, and it just does all this &#x27;react&#x27; stuff&quot; but I can&#x27;t explain
react to them I just say the code is automatically reacting to other things. My
parents say &quot;well if you are unhappy you might have to leave your job&quot; and they
are not like, cheering for me to leave, but they tell me that. At this point,
it really hit me that I do like this job and I decided to try to focus on work.</p><p><strong>I try and make an honest attempt to get involved in the project, start pair
programming</strong></p><p>On January 10th 2019 I make my first commit to the rewrite by doing some
monkey-see monkey-do type coding. I copy a bunch of files and just put them in
the right place, tweak some lines, and start to figure out how to make things
run. By the end of January 2019 I get my first code change merged. I also
suggested that we start doing <strong>pair-programming sessions</strong>. Once I started
these it made a huge difference for me in learning how to code.  The pair
programming often still way over my head due to how my coworker presented stuff
or how much he assumed I understood. Nevertheless, these were extremely helpful
for me to help get caught up.</p><p><strong>I start to reading &quot;Learning React&quot;</strong></p><p>In March 2019, I got the book &quot;Learning React&quot; (O&#x27;Reilly2017
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react/9781491954614/">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react/9781491954614/</a>) for my
kindle.  Reading this book was a big help I felt, and provided a needed &quot;brain
reset&quot; for me. The book worked well for me, I read it each night on my kindle,
and the functional component concepts were super enlightening. To me it was so
much better reading a book than say and internet tutorial because I could
focus, not have distractions, etc. My eyes would just glaze over every time I
clicked on React blog posts and stuff before this.</p><p>So anyways, March 2019 goes on, and I&#x27;m learning, but our codebase still feels
pretty complicated and alien. We use mobx-state-tree and the glue for
mobx-state-tree to react e.g. the mobx-react doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me. I
remember asking my coworkers why my component was not updating and they
eventually find out it&#x27;s because I keep not using the observe() wrapper around
my components.</p><p><strong>I start to experiment with Typescript</strong></p><p>In April 2019 I start to experiment with typescript and release a typescript
version of some data parsing code. I start by explicity specifying a lot of
types but I eventually start getting into the zen of &quot;type inference&quot; and I
turn off the @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type so I get implied
return types.</p><p><strong>I start using React hooks</strong></p><p>In May 2019 I try out my first React hook, I try a useState instead. It worked
well. I couldn&#x27;t really figure out why I would use it instead of the mobx state
management we used elsewhere, but the example was that it was a click and drag
and it made sense to keep that click and drag state local to the component
rather than the &quot;app&quot;</p><p><strong>I start using react-testing-library</strong></p><p>In June 2019, I create &quot;integration test&quot; level tests for our app. I had used
react-testing-library for some components before this, but this was using
react-testing-library to render the entire &quot;app level&quot; component.  I was happy
to pioneer this and was happy to try this out instead of doing true browser
tests, and I think this has worked out well.</p><p>Some caveats: I got very caught up with trying to do canvas tests initially. I
really wanted to use jest-mock-canvas but we were using offscreencanvas via a
pretty complicated string of things, so I don&#x27;t make progress here, and I also
got confused about the relationship between node-canvas and jest-mock-canvas
(they are basically totally different approaches). Later on, I find using
jest-image-snapshot of the canvas contents works nice (ref

of &quot;act warnings&quot; which were confusing. These were fixed in React 16.9
(released August 2019), but we had to ignore them and they basically just
confused me a lot and made it feel like I was battling a very complex system
rather than a nice simple one.</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>Overall, I just wanted to write up my whole experience. It felt really
difficult for me to make these changes. I also went through a breakup during
this time, had a bad living situation, etc. so things were a struggle. If
anyone else has had struggles learning react, tell your story, and let me know.
I&#x27;d like to also thank everyone who helped me along the way. I feel like a much
better coder now, yet, I should always keep growing. The feeling of
uncomfortableness could be a growing experience.</p><p>::: {#footer} <!-- -->[ July 4th, 2020 3:02pm ]<!-- -->{#timestamp} <!-- -->[work]<!-- -->{.tag} <!-- -->[life]<!-- -->{.tag}
