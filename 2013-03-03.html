experiments, and i have had trouble due to my poor understanding of
statistics. I have recently taken several classes that vastly improve my
practical understanding of subjects including the Data Analysis class on
coursera, the Computing for Data analysis class, and the Experimental
genome science class, all on coursera!! Currently, the data anlysis
approach has been invaluable, and i looked at the performance of
Normdiff scores for comparing experiments (Zheng et al. 2010).</p><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>I did this preliminary data analysis to compare two biological
replicates. I used the wiggle files produced using MACS that represent
the number of reads that overlap each genome position.  Then i
calculated the NormDiff using a short R script to get the background
subtracted and normalized scores.</p><p>After this, I analyzed the effectiveness of the normalization by
creating an &quot;MA plot&quot;. MA graphs the results of two experiments by using
the log product vs log ratio, or alternatively, using the added effect
vs the difference of two experiments (which is what I used). The idea is
that if the normalization is good, the differences or log ratios should
not be biased.</p><p><strong>Results</strong>\
\
As it turns out, the normalization is very good and the best fit line
almost flat (slope 0.05, 95% confidence interval +- 0.001). One of the
cool things of the NormDiff algorithm is that it estimates the variance
from a sliding window in the data, and this appears to stabilize the
normalization very effectively (see Figure 1).\

\
 I am fairly pleased with the results so I am making the data available
and the R code so you can reproduce the results if you want!! Next, I
want to look at the clustering and peak finding, and possibly evaluate
other models of normalization\
