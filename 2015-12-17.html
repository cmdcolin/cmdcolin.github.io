help for a friend in a computer science class, and talk about a nagging
feeling that really felt wrong for me.</p><p>So, a long time ago, in a land far far away, a friend took an
intermediate class on C++. I was first updated on his progress when he
emailed me to get some help with some compiler errors. I was happy to
help the young padawan. Here was the error:</p><pre><code>     test.cpp:42:43: error: non-ASCII characters are not allowed outside of literals
            and identifiers
          for (startScan = 0; startScan &lt; (size âˆ’ 1); startScan++)
                                                ^~
</code></pre><p>Now, what does this say to you? For me, it was actually very clear what
the error meant. It simply meant that this code was taken from
somewhere, and copied and pasted into the compiler. I know that because
if they had typed it themself, they definitely would not get this error,
because it is the error that implies something was automatically
converted to a unicode dash, mostly something done during copying and
pasting. At this point, I just kind of laughed, and helped him fix that.
I showed how the compiler is actually pretty smart and can help fix
these errors and then I said &quot;l8r dude&quot;.</p><p>The next week, I had another skype meeting with him, and this time I
wanted to help a little more. It was pretty clear when we started that
he was using code that was copied and pasted again. I said, &quot;uh,
ok,....I&#x27;m not sure we need that now, but let&#x27;s just keep going&quot;, and
then I sat down and started helping. I wanted to help get all the
details of the program working, so I helped guide the solution. Each
time we needed to test the program, it required repeating some input
lines via cin <!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->, which is really annoying (obviously, you should test
your code with unit tests, but universities don&#x27;t teach that, a rant for
another day). Anyways, it took awhile, because coding really does just
take time, but in the end he finally got it fixed and I said great job,
and he turned it in!</p><p>Now, on my friends last assignment, I got another call for help, and
when we started skype, I found yet again that he had copied code from
somewhere, which included a C++ class and a main function for doing
binary trees. I just simply said &quot;dude, delete that, we don&#x27;t need it&quot;
and so he deleted it, but I think maybe he had worked on this copied
code for awhile, and maybe felt it was kind of his, so was apprehensive.
I insisted though. Then we walked through the assignment again, very
slowly. I spent probably 2-3 hours helping him out that night. During
those hours, I saw him continually making many programming mistakes such
as just not knowing how to declare variable or a function properly, or
just not knowing what to do next. This was kind of frustrating!!! But I
wanted to absolutely teach him how to make it right! I was patient
though, and I wanted to teach a fun lesson, so I showed how you can do
some &quot;unit tests&quot; which avoids having to constantly re-enter your data
via cin<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->....</p><p>Now, the padawan completed his C++ class, and then we all were happy
ever after....but a disturbance in the force was sensed...

Image from <a href="http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/">http://zelcs.com/this-is-why-stackoverflow-sucks/</a></p><p>I was reminded about all this due to seeing that <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-on-the-stack-excha">StackOverflow is now
changing their &quot;license&quot; over all the little snippets of
code</a>
that are posted on their site. It just makes me reflect on literally HOW
OFTEN PEOPLE JUST COPY AND PASTE FROM THERE. They might understand what
they are doing, or they seriously might not!!! I think it is a real
problem that people sometimes do not understand, but I cannot deny that
it can be helpful too.</p><p>If I reflect on education in general, I recall when I took a University
level physics class... it was really hard! We had to enter our validated
solutions for the math problems into a computerized website homework
portal, and that involved being 100% correct about things. Now, what if
there was just a physicsoverflow, where they not only had Q&amp;A, but they
had &quot;programs&quot; that gave you all the right answers to your homework
problems that you could just copy and paste and use as solutions to your
homework? This isn&#x27;t even in the realm of asking for &quot;homework help&quot;
anymore, this is just pure cheating if you can copy your answers from
somewhere. It is disappointing though because this is what people are
doing in computer science!! These students are missing out on basic
understanding of code. !!thisIsNotOk();</p><p>Now, at least when I was being a tutor for my friend, I felt like my
advice helped my friend learn some things, not just give answers. But
what if I was not there? I guess there is a certain &quot;impersonal quality&quot;
that makes asking Google/StackOverflow for answers less like
conventional &quot;cheating&quot;, but that is still wrong. I think it would be
good if more expert knowledge was available for all people, and not just
copy and paste snippets. As a start, I thought that <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192385-life-after-moocs/fulltext">this post by Philip
Compeau and Pavel
Pevzner</a>
(who teach a Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC on Coursera) was very
interesting, and I really liked their quote:</p><p>&quot;Online education should move toward replicating the experience of
receiving one-on-one tutoring.&quot;</p><p>That sounds great, but how can this be acheived? And how can it be done
right? I think it really requires the student to &quot;learn how to learn&quot;</p><p>If I think back to a long time ago, I remember being in 4th or 5th grade
and I did a book report on World War 1, and I went to the library. I
remember desperately flipping through pages of a 100 page book to try to
find some snippets of information to support some basic idea that I
wanted to talk about. Maybe I wanted to know something specific, but the
problem was that I wasn&#x27;t REALLY READING THE BOOK! I probably could have
had a better understanding of the topic if I had just read it, or even a
part of it, and asked for help, but instead I just picked and chose
snippets from the book to &quot;sound smart&quot;. I am very guilty of this type
of error in many instances throughout my school career, so I am no
saint! I even have a phrase to describe this style of learning...I call
it &quot;predatory learning&quot; and it is probably the worst kind of learning
style. Predatory learners often pick and choose from scraps of info, but
they never get a full meal!</p><p>::: {#footer}
