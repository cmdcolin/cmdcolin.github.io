talent&quot; or &quot;we fired our top talent&quot;. Just maybe an inquiry to why
things happen as they do with high performing and low performing workers</p><p>\</p><p>In my experience, it seems like workers can be completely unproductive
even when they are &quot;coming into work every day&quot;. I can&#x27;t really explain
why, but I have been in unproductive roles where I was totally on dead
ends, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily because I was unskilled. For
example, I have also  been on projects where I just fully absorbed the
code and became a core contributor (maybe even became a &quot;Rick&quot;). Then it
was kind of insane because as a core contributor, when I looked around,
I just saw other people doing unproductive and even counterproductive
things.</p><p>Now, as the article says, where was &quot;management&quot;? Would they have
helped, for example to manage Rick better or spread work out, as the
article seems to suggest? IMO, I think not. Maybe the article is a plea
for better management (the article itself is a response to another one
where management simply fired their &quot;Rick&quot;) but I think it is just so
frequent that management is pretty incompetent in technical ways that I
have a hard idea of knowing whether my experience is bad or not (note
that I do believe, in many cases, that their diplomacy efforts and
people skills are pretty impressive so I don&#x27;t believe in &quot;no
management&quot;). But can they manage the technical work? I am not sure. For
example, management I have worked under always seem to have a bunch of
&quot;pet project&quot; features that they harped on about. We could have a
meeting every week, and this same thing would occur every other week,
and you have to repeatedly explain why it is a problem in the current
codebase. In some sense, as a core dev, you might even start to believe
the management is psychotic for even wanting some of these features that
they harp on about because there are so many more important real things
you need, and implementing their pet project or fixing their pet peeve
would actually damage the codebase. </p><p>The real work on the project isn&#x27;t the pet projects that management has,
it is plugging away at issues, enabling better code through good
abstractions (functional, architectural, object oriented, or
configuration abstractions). Good code often can just be a proliferation
of existing good code patterns in a monkey-see monkey-do thing, and
eventually you don&#x27;t always need to go to stackoverflow for an answer
eventually because the entire mental map you obtain enables you to pick
and choose solutions from your own project. Abstractions can then enable
certain more productive things to happen down the line, make things
flexible. Then many parts of code work in fixing issues should make
things more stable and accurate (hopefully you are not just working
yourself into a hacky soup when you are &quot;fixing&quot; your issues). In the
worst case, something you created actually just multiplies issues for
you because suddenly everything is dependent on a hack. Sometimes I feel
like some devs just really fail to see this and start to just hack
things to the fucking bone trying to make it work. If you are a
productive contributor working on the project, you might be able to
recognize a lot of these things, and hopefully realize that productive
is not just &quot;create hacks&quot; or &quot;we need to change frameworks&quot; (how many
conference calls have we had where management disparages library x as
being unhip? or calling the old devs &quot;dumb&quot; for not having implemented
their pet project before they quit? management can be dumb as a rock
imo, and as I no longer work there, I&#x27;m really happy to rip into their
bad habits)</p><p>What about the idea that things need &quot;documenting&quot; to enable other devs
to work on the project? I think this is a red herring. In fact, &quot;Rick&quot;
probably is documenting things if he&#x27;s a good developer. He probably has
important notes that you would understand if you were actually even
using the product as it is meant to be used (and not, simply using the
product to test whether your pet prioject was finally implemented, or
working on a crazy side project that is tangential to what most users
use the product for, these tangential misguided uses of your core
product often comes from UNPRODUCTIVE DEVS and MANAGEMENT not from RICK!
Rick probably has the best knowledge about not only the code, but also
the future potential of the project and the current needs of users (if
he does mail list support for example, he&#x27;s might be in correspondence
with users already). There might be a very deep configuration option
that Rick made that few people know about, but when you realize that
config variable exists, you will be so appreciative. In fact, you are
overjoyed because now you just flip that config switch instead of
editing the codebase and recompiling to enable something. The entry
probably exists in documentation, but you don&#x27;t care until you need it.
Also, the original article seems to claim that these config switches
add &quot;complexity&quot; and claim their trimmed down version that they made
&quot;without Rick&quot; is more &quot;bug free&quot; but many times, config switches can be
completely painless (e.g. read a global json object. that&#x27;s absolutely
painless in javascript. don&#x27;t complain about globals to me for a read
only config) and don&#x27;t add significant complexity, they actually just
add flexibility!</p><p>Now, I&#x27;ve had devs explain &quot;architecture&quot; to me, and afterwards it
completely means nothing to me. They give me some crazy idea that
essentially boils down to &quot;oh this is MVC, and there are some crazy
modules at each layer, but yea, enjoy&quot; and I really am not enlightened
at all. To even get what&#x27;s going on, I have to begin deeply working with
the code. Now because of that, there might be a sort of explanation of
why a dev is unproductive, namely that for whatever reason or another,
they are not taking a dive into the code, and therefore, they just don&#x27;t
engage. Learning to use &quot;grep&quot; and everything to find what part of code
does whatever thing is really important as far as this goes, but
eventually, you need to just get a big mental map of everything.\</p><p>The idea of a developer having a &quot;responsibility&quot; for their code is
something that I truly think could be important too. You can really only
build the mental map if you are doing things with the code, so for
example, a successful project would have a good system of getting
developers on tasks that are appropriate and reasonable. In a project I
succeeded in, the original developers left the project and I was
basically in a position where I could take up a lot of slack and
responsibility for the project, so I did so with eagerness. In another
example, I&#x27;ve been given projects that I don&#x27;t feel like is part of the
core product or even the core codebase (being assigned smaller code
projects that may or may not find use in a core product)</p><p>If I was to make an analogy, sometimes you need to really take some
personal responsibility to make a project happen. When I am working on
home repairs, of which I have a LOT of as I am basically fixing up
houses in my spare time now, I find that I can simply be of assistance
my friend who is also helping fix the house, or I can spearhead a
project on my own. Or, my friend (who is better at repairs than me) can
kindly suggest a project that I can do. In one sense, he can be a
manager but only because he really knows what is also going on in the
codebase. But I can also, take the responsibility to make things happen
myself. If I have a good enough mental map of what to do, I can then
perform all the google queries, the store trips, know what tools to use,
and execute all on my own.</p><p>With my house-fixing-up project, if I was to have my parents be
&quot;management&quot; (they love getting pictures of progress and making
suggestions) then literally what they keep telling me to do is put in a
washer and dryer in, even though we are not even finished with demo
(demolition) work and the place is a mess. Surely they know some other
stuff, and might even be able to suggest things to do or people to call
if they were more deeply involved, but basically, the management can&#x27;t
help very deeply. Similarly, documentation of all my work isn&#x27;t going to
help, because really it is the process of being involved in the coding
and fixing of existing issues that makes you know what needs work. The
documentation, per se, is all online on google for example &quot;how to put
in light switch&quot; but your mental map of what needs to go where in the
house is what pushes the project forward.</p><p>::: {#footer}
